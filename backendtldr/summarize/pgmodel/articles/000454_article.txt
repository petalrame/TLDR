'' sledge never saw a dime of songwriting royalties . he had some regrets about that , he told blues and soul magazine -- the song would have helped provide for his children -- but he accepted it . `` worst decision i ever made . but i am not at all bitter . i figure if god wanted me to do what i did , and say what i did to tell those guys they could have the song , then i 'll leave it that away , '' he told the magazine . `` when a man loves a woman '' became a standard , covered many times -- michael bolton took it to no . 1 in 1991 -- and featured on several movie soundtracks . it was even the title of a 1994 film starring andy garcia and meg ryan . sledge 's version also returned to the charts , hitting the uk top 10 in 1987 . even with his other hits , he said , it all came back to `` when a man loves a woman . '' `` the granddaddy to all of my songs . the boss of all of my songs . i have great respect for that song , '' he told blues and soul . `` always will . '' sledge was inducted into the rock hall in 2005 . his death was followed two weeks later by that of another '60s soul legend , ben e. king , who had an enduring hit in 1961 with `` stand by me . '' people we 've lost in 2015 . cnn 's john newsome contributed to this story .
