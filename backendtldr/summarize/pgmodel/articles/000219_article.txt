( cnn ) it was like a scene out of `` make way for ducklings '' on tuesday on a rainy street in washington . cnn situation room correspondent brian todd and photojournalist khalil abdallah were on their way to interview a legal analyst on l street nw when they happened on a brood of baby ducks causing a stir . abdallah reports the ducklings and their mom had crossed heavily trafficked street , and some restaurant patrons stopped on the sidewalk to corral them . a man gave up his umbrella for the cause `` while the mom was going crazy . '' `` one duckling tried to run back to the street but they caught it in time , '' abdallah said . the mother duck followed the umbrella while pedestrians stopped cars on l street for them to safely cross the road . the washington post reports the pedestrians took the bird family to `` a more enclosed grassy area '' at 16th and l streets nw . ( yes , baby ducks warrant two national news stories . ) `` we thought it was an extraordinary situation , '' todd said . `` you see pigeons , you see squirrels , you see the occasional raccoon in the d.c. area , and ... you see deer ... we 've never seen anything like this in the middle of town .
