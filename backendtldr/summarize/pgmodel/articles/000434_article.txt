( cnn ) cigarettes have been put out across the bars of new orleans . cigars are welcome no more . the city known for excess of everything -- drinking , eating , dancing in the street until all hours -- went smoke-free as tuesday became wednesday at midnight . how can that be ? it turns out that the city known for its over-the-top mardi gras celebrations and incredible jazz fests ( starting friday ! ) did n't want its waiters and musicians to have to breathe smoke to do their jobs anymore . the new orleans city council passed its ban against smoking in most places across the city -- including bars , casinos and restaurants -- in january , and the vote was unanimous , the new orleans times-picayune reports . bar owners worried about potential revenue loss , while puffing customers bemoaned the loss of their smoking spots . harrah 's new orleans and bar owners filed a lawsuit to stop the ban , and a hearing is scheduled in state court in a month , cnn affiliate wapt reports . fines start at $ 50 . luckily for us , none of cnn 's 15 new orleans must-do 's -- including touring treme or eating a beignet -- requires smoking .
