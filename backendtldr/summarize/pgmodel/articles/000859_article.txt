( cnn ) civil unions between people of the same sex will soon be recognized in chile . the country joined several of its south american neighbors in allowing the unions when president michelle bachelet enacted a new law on monday . `` this is a concrete step in the drive to end the difference between homosexual and heterosexual couples , '' bachelet said . the new law will take effect in six months . it will give legal weight to cohabiting relationships between two people of the same sex and between a man and a woman . the chilean government estimates that around 2 million people will be able to benefit from the change . the law is intended to end discrimination faced by common-law couples , such as not being allowed to visit partners in hospital , make medical decisions on their behalf or decide what to do with their remains . it also gives the couples greater rights in the realms of property , health care , pensions and inheritance . a number of south american nations have moved to allow same-sex civil unions in recent years . but marriage between people of the same sex is legal only in argentina , brazil and uruguay .
