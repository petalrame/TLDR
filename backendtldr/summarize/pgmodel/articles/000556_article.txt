( cnn ) a dress worn by vivien leigh as she played scarlett o'hara in `` gone with the wind '' has fetched $ 137,000 at an auction . that 's a pretty healthy profit for the collector who bought the outfit decades ago for a mere $ 20 as it was on the verge of being tossed out . the outfit , a gray two-piece ensemble , was sold at an auction in beverly hills , california , on saturday , according to heritage auctions . it was the most sought after item among roughly 150 pieces of `` gone with the wind '' memorabilia on sale in the auction . they come from the huge collection amassed by james tumblin , who used to work at universal studios . tumblin said he came across the scarlett o'hara dress in the early 1960s while doing some research at a costume company . `` i saw this dress on the floor and a docent told me not to bother to pick it up , because they were throwing it away , '' he said , according to the telegraph . `` i asked if he would sell it to me , '' he said . `` i had noticed there was a printed label saying selznick international pictures and ' scarlett production dress ' was written in ink . '' from that savvy purchase , his `` gone with the wind '' collection snowballed . other standout items include a straw hat worn by leigh in a number of scenes in the movie and a gray wool suit worn by clark gable as his character , rhett butler , kicks down the door of scarlett o'hara 's boudoir . the dress -- a jacket and full skirt ensemble -- was worn in several key scenes in the 1939 movie , including when scarlett o'hara encounters butler and when she gets attacked in the shanty town . the outfit has suffered a little with age , however . when leigh wore it in the movie , it was slate blue-gray . over the years , it 's faded to light gray . but that did n't deter the winning bidder on saturday .
