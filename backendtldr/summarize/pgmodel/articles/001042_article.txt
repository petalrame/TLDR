( cnn ) australian prime minister tony abbott has been caught on camera guzzling a glass of beer in seven seconds amid raucous cheers from onlookers . his feat of swift consumption in a crowded bar impressed some people but annoyed others . and observers were quick to point out that abbott had previously criticized binge drinking in australia . abbott was in a sydney pub on saturday evening when a group of australian rules football players invited him to have a drink with them . the prime minister accepted and even gave a short , impromptu speech , one of the football coaches , simon carrodus , told the australian woman 's weekly . `` then he proceeds to reach down and grab a schooner and he drank from head-to-toe the entire schooner , dribbling little bits on his shirt ... tipped it upside down on his head . and he was proud as punch , '' carrodus said . a schooner holds about three-quarters of a pint . video of abbott making short work of the beer as the crowd around him chants `` skol ! skol ! '' drew plenty of attention on social media . some commentators focused on abbott 's drinking technique . but others suggested he was setting a bad example . abbott had attacked binge drinking as recently as last year . `` like most australians , i enjoy a drink on social occasions , '' he said in january 2014 . `` however , as a father and as a citizen , i 'm appalled by the violent binge drinking culture that now seems so prevalent , especially at `` hot spots '' in our big cities . '' casting those concerns aside , some social media users belittled abbott 's beer swilling . they said his effort was a pale imitation of the legendary drinking exploits of former prime minister bob hawke , who is credited with drinking two and a half pints in 11 seconds .
