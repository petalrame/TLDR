( cnn ) beer and ice cream . it does n't exactly spring to mind when you think of classic food pairings -- old friends such as bacon and eggs or steak and cabernet . but colorado 's new belgium brewery and the folks at ben & jerry 's are teaming up on a beer inspired by ice cream -- salted caramel brownie ice cream , to be precise . `` at this time i can confirm that ben & jerry 's and new belgium are collaborating to raise awareness around issues we are passionate about , and that the results will be delicious , '' new belgium 's director of sustainability , jenn vervier , said in a statement . both companies have a history of social activism , and the new project will be no different , they say . their release does n't say what the campaign will be all about , but ben & jerry 's senior global marketing manager jay curley promises it will be `` impactful . '' `` we 're big fans of new belgium brewery , their values , and their fun culture , and of course their beer , '' he said . `` we 're excited for the campaign we 've developed together . '' the companies will announce the details later this year , and the beer is set to hit shelves in the fall . new belgium and ben & jerry 's are both what are called `` b corporations , '' a certification issued by the private non-profit b labs to companies that meet its social , environmental , accountability and transparency standards . new belgium supports sustainable agriculture , climate change and other initiatives , while ben & jerry 's -- now a subsidiary of global conglomerate unilever -- stays true to its hippie roots with support for environmental initiatives , fair trade efforts , marriage equality and more . last month , ben & jerry 's cofounder ben cohen said he 'd be open to the idea of a marijuana-infused ice cream someday , news that set pot fans ablaze . but sadly for beer fans , there 's no talk of a beer-flavored ice cream . not yet anyway .
