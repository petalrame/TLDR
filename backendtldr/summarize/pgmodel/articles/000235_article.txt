( cnn ) are you smarter than a really smart singapore high school student ? see if you can figure out cheryl 's birthday , the singapore logic problem that 's got the internet twisted into knots . some are even saying it 's the math equivalent of the `` what color is the dress '' debate . the puzzling problem went viral after singapore television host kenneth kong posted it to facebook . cheryl 's birthday challenge was meant to test the better high-school students competing in the singapore and asian schools math olympiad , held april 8 . here it is : cheryl has a birthday , and she does n't want to share it right away . ( otherwise , we have no challenge to solve . ) so she gives her friends albert and bernard a list of 10 possible birthday dates : may 15 , may 16 , may 19 , june 17 , june 18 , july 14 , july 16 , august 14 , august 15 or august 17 . a brief conversation between albert and bernard -- who we assume are not lying for the sake of this problem -- gives the reader enough clues to eliminate nine of the 10 dates and discover cheryl 's birthday . that 's assuming you want to celebrate with cheryl after she 's put you through all that trouble . see our video below for the answer from georgia tech mathematician matt baker . the new york times and the washington post have also posted solutions to the problem , along with explanations . of course , the internet has offered other solutions .
