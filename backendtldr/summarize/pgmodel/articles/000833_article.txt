( cnn ) that 's some rich `` american pie . '' the lyrics to the famed don mclean song sold for $ 1.2 million tuesday morning at an auction held by christie 's . `` don mclean 's manuscript of ' american pie ' achieved the 3rd highest auction price for an american literary manuscript , a fitting tribute to one the foremost singer-songwriters of his generation , '' christie 's tom lecky said in a statement . mclean told rolling stone that it was time to part with the manuscript . `` i 'm going to be 70 this year , '' the singer and songwriter said in february . `` i have two children and a wife , and none of them seem to have the mercantile instinct . i want to get the best deal that i can for them . it 's time . '' over the years , `` american pie '' has become one of the most dissected and argued-about songs in the pop music canon . mclean has said that the opening lines were inspired by the death of buddy holly , but after that , it 's all been conjecture -- which has n't stopped a marching band 's worth of analysts from trying to parse the symbols in the 8-minute , 33-second opus . is the jester bob dylan ? the football game vietnam ? the `` girl who sang the blues '' janis joplin ? ( one thing 's certain : buddy holly 's plane was not named `` american pie . '' ) `` over the years i 've dealt with all these stupid questions of ' who 's that ? ' and ' who 's that ? ' `` mclean said . `` these are things i never had in my head for a second when i wrote the song . i was trying to capture something very ephemeral and i did , but it took a long time . '' the song catapulted the former folk singer to headliner status . the song hit no . 1 in early 1972 , despite its length . ( the 45-rpm single split the song in half on its a and b sides . ) the draft that was auctioned is 16 pages : 237 lines of manuscript and 26 lines of typed text , according to christie 's . it includes lines that did n't make the final version as well as extensive notes -- all of which should be revealing , mclean said . the record for a popular music manuscript is held by bob dylan 's `` like a rolling stone , '' which sold for $ 2 million in june . opinion : what 's so great about ' american pie ' ?
