hong kong ( cnn ) phil rudd , the drummer for legendary hard rock band ac/dc , has pleaded guilty to charges of threatening to kill and possession of drugs in a new zealand court . rudd , who previously denied all allegations , made a surprise guilty plea tuesday before the trial began . the 60-year-old australian was arrested in november last year after police found methamphetamine and cannabis while executing a search warrant at his home in new zealand . according to a court summary , rudd fired several employees because the release of his solo album in august had flopped in the charts . a month later , he called an associate and said he wanted his personal assistant `` taken out . '' he later then called the victim -- his personal assistant -- on the phone and said , `` i 'm going to come over and kill you . '' rudd made several calls to his personal assistant over the following days , but he terminated the calls after realizing it was rudd on the phone . `` as a result of the threats made by the defendant , the victim was genuinely very fearful of his safety , '' read the summary . the drummer 's lawyer , craig tuck , told reporters outside the court that the charges were `` essentially just an angry phone call . '' `` i will be seeking to have him discharged without conviction , '' tuck added in an email to cnn . rudd could face up to seven years in prison for the charge of threatening to kill . he is currently released on bail until the sentencing hearing on june 26 . in november , the court dropped the police charge of `` attempting to procure murder '' after prosecutors decided there was n't enough evidence .
