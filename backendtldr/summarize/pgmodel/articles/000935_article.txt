( cnn ) oklahoma gov . mary fallin signed a bill on friday that would allow the state to perform executions with nitrogen gas if lethal injection is ruled unconstitutional or becomes unavailable . nitrogen causes a quick loss of consciousness and then death from lack of oxygen , fallin 's office said in a press release . cnn affiliate kfor says it 's never been used in an execution in the united states . `` the person will become unconscious within eight to 10 seconds and death a few minutes later . in other words , a humane , quick and painless death , '' said rep. mike christian , one of the bill 's authors , according to kfor . robert dunham , executive director of the death penalty information center , told the washington post that the same `` painless '' argument had been used to advance the use of lethal injections . `` the hasty manner in which this bill sped into law reflects the same lack of care with which oklahoma has managed its execution process historically , '' he said . oklahoma 's executions have been put on hold while the u.s. supreme court reviews its use of lethal injections . last year , the state came under scrutiny when it took 43 minutes to kill convicted killer clayton lockett . fallin reaffirmed her support for the death penalty . `` oklahoma executes murderers whose crimes are especially heinous , '' fallin said . `` i support that policy , and i believe capital punishment must be performed effectively and without cruelty . the bill i signed today gives the state of oklahoma another death penalty option that meets that standard . '' the governor 's office said the first alternative for execution is lethal injection , followed by nitrogen gas , the electric chair and the firing squad .
