( cnn ) some fans of lucille ball want her statue removed from a park in her hometown , saying the `` ugly '' likeness does not do justice to the `` i love lucy '' star . the life-size bronze statue in celoron , new york , has been likened to conway twitty , the snake from `` beetlejuice '' and actor steve buscemi , among other unflattering comparisons . even mayor scott schrecengost has gone on record saying he does not care for the statue , which shows the comic star holding a bottle of fictional nutrition elixir vitameatavegamin . and yet , it has been a tourist draw since 2009 for celoron , the comedian 's birthplace , attracting visitors who pose with the statue for pictures . a resident of jamestown , where ball grew up , started the facebook page in 2012 `` we love lucy ! get rid of this statue , '' seeking to get rid of the `` ugly '' statue . a story about the group on yahoo ! news this week spread through the internet , reviving debate over what to do with the statue . the founder of the facebook group would like to see the statue replaced with a new one outside a planned comedy hall of fame in jamestown , home to the lucy-desi museum & center for comedy and the annual lucille ball comedy festival . the founder requested anonymity , saying the issue is `` not about me ; it 's about the statue . '' `` lucille ball was one of the most talented , beautiful , funny women who ever appeared on television ; a pioneer , a giant of television . my only goal is to have a sculpture of her in jamestown which does her justice , '' the group 's founder told cnn . `` this statue in celoron is not fixable . i love my hometown and i love lucy . let 's get a new statue that is a real tribute to her memory as the comedy queen of television . '' a buffalo news columnist vouched for the sentiment , saying `` its deranged grimace and jagged teeth inspire more dread than reverence . '' `` no one here much likes the statue , and one look tells you why . it looks more like an extra from ' the walking dead ' than arguably the most famous comic actress of all time , '' colin dabkowski wrote saturday . still , residents take pride in their claim to fame , `` even if some of them privately wish that the statue commemorating her would be struck by lightning . '' the artist who created the statue did not respond to cnn 's request for comment . in a post this week , the facebook group founder said the point was not to `` disparage '' the artist or his work . but , in this case , `` this lucy statue is just not up to his usual work . '' schrecengost told the local post-journal that he reached out to the artist over the years about redoing the statue . `` he finally came back and said he wanted $ 8,000 to $ 10,000 to do it . i 've also reached out to several other sculptors in the region , and some said they would do it , but we 're still looking at about $ 5,000 , '' he told the newspaper . `` we 'd like to work with the original sculptor and wish he would stand behind his work enough to step up and fix it for free .
