( cnn ) five years ago , rebecca francis posed for a photo while lying next to a dead giraffe . this week , she got threatened for her action . the trouble started monday , when comedian ricky gervais tweeted the photo with a question . `` what must 've happened to you in your life to make you want to kill a beautiful animal & then lie next to it smiling ? '' gervais wrote . in the past three days , his tweet has been retweeted almost 30,000 times . a number of people insulted and threatened francis in response to the giraffe photo and others featuring her . on the website rebeccafrancis.com , there are photos of francis with other animals , including a lion , which other twitterers responded to . francis , who has appeared on the nbc sports network outdoor lifestyle show `` eye of the hunter '' and was the subject of an interview with hunting life in late march , responded in a statement to huntinglife.com on tuesday , which was posted on its facebook page . the death came about , she said , because she was asked by others on an african hunt to `` preserve '' him for the local people . `` ( the locals ) showed me this beautiful old bull giraffe that was wandering all alone . he had been kicked out of the herd by a younger and stronger bull . he was past his breeding years and very close to death , '' she said . `` they asked me if i would preserve this giraffe by providing all the locals with food and other means of survival . ... i chose to honor his life by providing others with his uses and i do not regret it for one second . ( the locals ) did not waste a single part of him . i am grateful to be a part of something so good . '' according to the giraffe conservation foundation , there are about 80,000 giraffes in africa , a decline of 60,000 in the past 15 years . on a website called rebeccafrancis.com , where the photo is posted , francis describes herself as a longtime outdoors enthusiast and a fan of bow-hunting . `` i prefer bowhunting , and the animals i have taken with a bow include : a 10 1/2 ft. brown bear , black bear , shiras moose , alaskan moose , dall sheep , stone sheep , desert bighorn ram , rocky mountain bighorn ram , mule deer , whitetail deer , elk , mountain goat , antelope , arapawa ram , kudu , zebra , black wildebeest , giraffe , springbuck , blesbuck , lynx , badger , and squirrel , '' she writes . `` i have also taken many of the same species and more with a rifle . '' she has achieved the `` full curl of north american sheep '' with a bow , according to the hunting life interview , and hopes to achieve the `` super 10 . '' the latter , according to liveoutdoors.com , `` entails the taking of one animal from the ten basic north american species : bears , cats , deer , elk , caribou , moose , bison/muskox , goat , antelope and sheep . '' tom opre , the producer and co-host of `` eye of the hunter , '' says she won the first season of `` extreme huntress , '' an online offshoot of `` eye , '' and co-hosted a handful of `` eye '' episodes . the rebeccafrancis.com website was apparently last updated in 2013 , though it makes mention of a 2015 tv series called `` sheep shape '' on the sportsman channel . cnn has reached out to francis for comment .
