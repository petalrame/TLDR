( cnn ) the third blood moon in a four-part series was the shortest eclipse of the bunch , but still a sweet treat for early risers in north america . the moon slipped fully into earth 's shadow at 4:58 a.m. pacific time ( 7:58 a.m . et ) saturday , starting a total lunar eclipse for nearly five minutes -- what nasa says will be the shortest such eclipse of the century . the celestial body took on a burnt-orange tint in the minutes before , during and after the total eclipse , giving the moon the appearance that earns total eclipses the `` blood moon '' nickname . watchers in the eastern half of north america caught only a partial eclipse -- and in some places , an orange one -- before the moon set below the horizon . the event started at 3:16 a.m. pt ( 6:16 a.m . et ) , when the moon began moving into earth 's shadow . `` the lunar eclipse is looking good ! '' tweeted ryan hoke , a meteorologist for cnn affiliate wave in louisville , kentucky , showing a picture of a reddish partial moon in a blue dawn sky . people from the u.s. west coast to australia were able to catch the total eclipse . parts of south america , india , china and russia were able to see at least parts of the event , but it was n't visible in greenland , iceland , europe , africa or the middle east . a lunar eclipse happens when the sun , earth and moon form a straight line in space , with the earth smack in the middle . the sun shines on the earth and creates a shadow . as the moon moves deeper into that shadow , it appears to turn dark and may even appear to be a reddish color . why red ? because earth 's atmosphere is filtering out most of the blue light . nasa says lunar eclipses typically happen at least twice a year , but this eclipse is the third in a series of four in a row , known as a `` tetrad . '' the first was april 15 , 2014 , and the second was october 23 , 2014 . the space agency predicts the next one will come september 28 . did you see it ? share your photos with cnn ireport .
