( cnn ) a year after its cannes debut and finally seeing a theatrical release , `` lost river '' is still causing quite a stir . booed at its premiere and mocked by reviewers , ryan gosling 's first feature as director has been divisive , to put it mildly . but there has been one shining light cutting through the fog of critical hyperbole : its setting , a besmirched and decaying detroit . wavering on the brink of annihilation , yet providing kindling for its own rebirth , the city is captured in all its waning splendor , the perfect backdrop for gosling 's post-industrial gothic . speaking about the film in london , gosling made clear that the city was at the heart of the project -- in fact , without detroit 's crumbling edifices there would be no film at all . gosling said that `` lost river '' began as a collection of speculative shots of the brewster-douglass projects , the first black social housing development in america and a place motown legends the supremes and boxer joe louis once called home . `` i heard [ the authorities ] were going to tear them down , '' gosling said . `` i had to shoot them before they did . '' taking time out between acting jobs , he ventured into the projects . `` i started shooting more and more , '' he explained , `` and then i realized that i was making a film . then i started writing [ the script ] during the process of filming . '' gosling 's affection for the motor city is longstanding , the actor growing up `` not too far away '' in cornwall , ontario . `` it seemed like everything cool came from detroit ... the whole american dream , '' he reminisces . `` the model-t , motown , the refrigerator ... '' now though he references `` 40 miles of dead neighborhoods , '' the city declaring bankruptcy . `` houses are burning and things are being torn down , '' he says , `` and within that there are families trying to hold on to their homes . for them it has become a nightmare and i wanted to make a film about that . '' the title itself alludes to a once thriving community now displaced , its homes at the bottom of a reservoir built with little concern for the residents -- man-made interference with untold social repercussions . speaking in broader terms , gosling argues `` there are lost rivers everywhere and we wanted to share the experience these people were having . '' on screen he paints a nihilistic image of wanton destruction ; torched properties and bulldozers jostling for our attention amid acts of extreme human violence -- sometimes self-inflicted . the director plainly states that as a location it `` was pretty dangerous . '' he describes `` an energy there that was threatening ... we had a very charmed experience [ filming ] . it worked its way into the fabric of the movie -- - a tone of impending threat that was just there . '' however there are signs of humanity and regeneration amongst the chaos , on camera and off . for the film 's young protagonist , every raid on an unoccupied house offers copper piping waiting to be recast and ultimately reclaimed . similarly , gosling references the heidelberg project during the discussion , a community organization in the city 's mcdougall-hunt neighborhood , reimagining derelict buildings as giant canvases for budding artists . he recalls seeing `` one house covered with teddy bears , another covered in clocks ... people taking spaces and personalizing them . '' the city 's scope for urban renewal was clearly a draw . `` something really interesting is happening in detroit at the moment -- a rebirth . people redefining what they are , '' according to gosling . `` there 's a resilience there and an energy , and it 's exciting . '' as much as the visual content of `` lost river '' revolves around a maudlin preoccupation with dereliction -- and perhaps plays on the outside world 's perception of detroit -- aspects of the narrative suggest hope and the possibility of reincarnation for the city . gosling claims this paradox should exist when discussing detroit , and is precisely what the film is trying to convey . `` we want people to know that dereliction is happening there , but that it 's not only what is happening there , '' he argues . `` it does n't define detroit , it 's just part of what it 's dealing with right now . '' `` lost river '' receives a limited theatrical release in the u.s. and uk on april 10 .
