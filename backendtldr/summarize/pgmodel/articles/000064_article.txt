( cnn ) no identification , no social security card and only a box to live on . john helinski was homeless and nameless for three years . suddenly , he 's set to buy his own place and collect a nice pension . helinski hit it big thanks to the social security administration , and a big-hearted cop and a case worker determined to untangle major bureaucracy . charles inman could not bear to see his 62-year-old ward land back on the street , he told cnn affiliate wfts . the shelter where the case worker works set helinski up with a bunk and a locker . but getting him into the system was hard , because helinski 's id and social security cards had been stolen . `` he needed to have an identification , but we could n't get an identification without a birth certificate , '' inman said . a hassle all by itself , except that helinski was foreign born -- in poland , as an american citizen . `` we first had to figure out that we needed a consular record of foreign birth or something like that , '' said tampa police officer dan mcdonald , who pitched in to help helinski . with those papers squared away , he and inman got helinski a driver 's license and a social security card . then , helinski remembered that he used to have an account with a certain landmark bank . `` then it became bank of america , '' he said . the account was still there , and the social security administration had n't forgotten about him . it had kept paying helinski benefits for years , and they had stacked up high . now helinski is thinking of buying his own four walls . and he 'll have monthly benefits to live on . `` i guess i 'm exhilarated , excited , you know , '' he said . mcdonald said he and inman were stunned . `` we were n't quite sure what to say .
