( cnn ) facebook may soon need to add `` just got served divorce papers '' to its list of relationship statuses now that a new york judge has said the social media site is an acceptable way for a brooklyn woman to serve her husband with a summons for divorce . ellanora arthur baidoo has been trying to divorce her husband for several years , according to her attorney , andrew spinnell . but , spinnell said , he and his client have n't been able to find victor sena blood-dzraku to serve him the papers . baidoo has been able to reach her husband by phone and `` he has told her that he has no fixed address and no place of employment , '' according to court documents . `` he has also refused to make himself available to be served , '' the document said . after exhausting other ways of serving him the papers , spinnell filed an application asking for `` service by alternate means , '' in this case , via social media . in his decision , justice matthew cooper said the `` advent and ascendency of social media , '' means sites like facebook and twitter are the `` next frontier '' as `` forums through which a summons can be delivered . '' before cooper agreed to her using facebook , baidoo had to prove the facebook account belongs to her husband , and that he consistently logs on to the account and would therefore see the summons . spinnell said baidoo 's marriage to blood-dzraku began to unravel shortly after they married in 2009 because her husband refused to participate in a ghanian wedding ceremony that would include both their families . the couple never lived together , according to court documents . `` she 's not asking for any money , '' spinnell said , `` she just wants to move on with her life and get a divorce . '' spinnell said he has contacted blood-dzraku twice on facebook , but has yet to hear back . if blood-dzraku refuses the summons , spinnell said the judge can move forward with a `` divorce by default '' for his client . blood-dzraku could not be reached for comment .
