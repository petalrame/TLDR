tokyo ( cnn ) the operator of the crippled fukushima daiichi nuclear plant has given up trying to recover a robotic probe after it stopped moving inside one of the reactors . tokyo electric power company ( tepco ) deployed the remote-controlled robot on friday inside one of the damaged reactors that had suffered a meltdown following a devastating earthquake and tsunami in 2011 . it was the first time the probe had been used . the robot , set out to collect data on radiation levels and investigate the spread of debris , stalled after moving about 10 meters , according to a statement released by tepco . a newly released report and footage from the robot shows that a fallen object had blocked its path and left it stranded . tepco decided to cut off the cable connected to the device sunday as it had already covered two-thirds of the originally planned route . it managed to collect data on radiation levels in 14 of the 18 targeted locations . four years after the devastating nuclear crisis , the radiation levels inside the three damaged reactors are still extremely high and remain unsafe for people to enter . decommissioning work is estimated to cost $ 50 billion and will take years to complete . tepco called the robotic probe an `` unprecedented '' experiment . cnn 's yoko wakatsuki reported from tokyo , japan and naomi ng wrote from hong kong .
