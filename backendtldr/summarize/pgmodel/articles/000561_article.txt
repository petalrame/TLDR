( cnn ) paul walker is hardly the first actor to die during a production . but walker 's death in november 2013 at the age of 40 after a car crash was especially eerie given his rise to fame in the `` fast and furious '' film franchise . the release of `` furious 7 '' on friday offers the opportunity for fans to remember -- and possibly grieve again -- the man that so many have praised as one of the nicest guys in hollywood . `` he was a person of humility , integrity , and compassion , '' military veteran kyle upham said in an email to cnn . walker secretly paid for the engagement ring upham shopped for with his bride . `` we did n't know him personally but this was apparent in the short time we spent with him . i know that we will never forget him and he will always be someone very special to us , '' said upham . the actor was on break from filming `` furious 7 '' at the time of the fiery accident , which also claimed the life of the car 's driver , roger rodas . producers said early on that they would not kill off walker 's character , brian o'connor , a former cop turned road racer . instead , the script was rewritten and special effects were used to finish scenes , with walker 's brothers , cody and caleb , serving as body doubles . there are scenes that will resonate with the audience -- including the ending , in which the filmmakers figured out a touching way to pay tribute to walker while `` retiring '' his character . at the premiere wednesday night in hollywood , walker 's co-star and close friend vin diesel gave a tearful speech before the screening , saying `` this movie is more than a movie . '' `` you 'll feel it when you see it , '' diesel said . `` there 's something emotional that happens to you , where you walk out of this movie and you appreciate everyone you love because you just never know when the last day is you 're gon na see them . '' there have been multiple tributes to walker leading up to the release . diesel revealed in an interview with the `` today '' show that he had named his newborn daughter after walker . social media has also been paying homage to the late actor . a week after walker 's death , about 5,000 people attended an outdoor memorial to him in los angeles . most had never met him . marcus coleman told cnn he spent almost $ 1,000 to truck in a banner from bakersfield for people to sign at the memorial . `` it 's like losing a friend or a really close family member ... even though he is an actor and we never really met face to face , '' coleman said . `` sitting there , bringing his movies into your house or watching on tv , it 's like getting to know somebody . it really , really hurts . '' walker 's younger brother cody told people magazine that he was initially nervous about how `` furious 7 '' would turn out , but he is happy with the film . `` it 's bittersweet , but i think paul would be proud , '' he said . cnn 's paul vercammen contributed to this report .
