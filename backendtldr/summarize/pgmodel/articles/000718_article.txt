( cnn ) comedian chris rock made light of racial disparities in police treatment of whites and blacks with a tongue-in-cheek guide to not being beaten by the police . he encapsulated the frustration and grief caused by a new york grand jury 's decision not to indict a white police officer in the death of a black man with a simple tweet : `` this one was on film . '' now , he 's stirring things up again with a series of tweets documenting three traffic stops in seven weeks . `` stopped by the cops again wish me luck , '' he posted early tuesday , along with a photo showing him behind the wheel of a car with what looks like blue police lights in the background . he posted similar photos in february . many african-americans have long bemoaned the phenomenon of being pulled over for no apparent reason , calling it `` driving while black . '' blacks are about 30 % more likely to be pulled over by police than whites , according to figures reported by the bureau of justice statistics in 2013 . and in amid increased conversation over race and policing after the high-profile deaths last year of eric garner in new york and michael brown in ferguson , missouri , the issue is even more sensitive . rock has n't commented on the tweets and did n't say how the police stop turned out . he got lots of support on twitter . `` my heart legit dropped , no kidding , '' one twitter fan posted . many praised him for documenting the stops . some accused him of race-baiting . but one bit of advice in particular lit up social media . actor isaiah washington urged rock to `` # adapt '' to avoid racial profiling . `` i sold my $ 90,000.00 mercedes g500 and bought 3 prius 's , because i got tired of being pulled over by police , '' washington tweeted . some saw that as a sell-out , saying rock should n't have to take steps others might not have to as a way to avoid being pulled over . `` let me guess..you also make sure your pants are pulled up as well ? . '' twitter user yeshacallahan posted . appearing on cnn , washington defended the tweet , saying he wanted to `` excite a conversation . '' years ago , rock filmed a sketch for his `` chris rock '' show on hbo in which he detailed ways to avoid being beaten by police as a black man . besides obeying the law , he suggested bringing a white friend along for the ride . he did just that last year in a segment of `` comedians in cars getting coffee '' with jerry seinfeld . the two chat as seinfeld drives an orange lamborghini . and what happened ? they get pulled over after seinfeld goes a bit heavy on the gas . `` here 's the crazy thing , '' rock tells seinfeld as the police officer stops the duo . `` if you were n't here , i 'd be scared .
