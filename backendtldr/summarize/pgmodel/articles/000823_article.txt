( cnn ) it 's a hard-knock life , jay z , especially on twitter . the uber private rapper/entrepreneur broke out of his usually reserved social media shell over the weekend to defend the performance of his new music streaming service , tidal . using the hashtag # tidalfacts , he attempted to refute talk that the company has been doing a less than stellar job in taking on competitor spotify . he launched the subscription-based music service last month with a star-studded news conference in which artists such as madonna , kanye west , daft punk and jay z 's wife , beyonce , came together in support of what singer alicia keys told the crowd was `` the first ever artist-owned global music and entertainment platform . '' cnn money : jay z 's tidal music service to be owned by artists . but less than a month after its debut , there 's been chatter that the service is underwhelming , and jay z 's `` stream of consciousness '' tweets denying that were met with some derision . and , of course , a tidal facts parody twitter account was quickly created to offer some `` facts '' of its own .
