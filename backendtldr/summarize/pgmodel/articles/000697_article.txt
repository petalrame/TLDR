'' she posted the picture to twitter , and within a few hours , it had already received hundreds of retweets . `` it 's been surreal i feel like we 're breaking the internet but in a really great way , '' she told cnn affiliate wpix . according to cnn weather producer rachel aissen , this would be a double rainbow that has been reflected in the sky , due to a smooth body of water underneath the rainbow . this is n't the first time rainbows have shown up in multiples . but the splendor of such a scene can render us speechless , even emotional -- much like the star of the famous `` double rainbow '' video . cnn ireporter yosemitebear vasquez posted a video to youtube in 2010 reacting to a double rainbow he spotted in yosemite national park . the video has since garnered over 40 million views . of course , we asked the unofficial rainbow spokesman to weigh in on the phenomenon . `` whoa , that 's a quadruple rainbow ! all the way , '' he exclaims . `` what does it mean ?
