( cnn ) editor 's note : ines dumig was recently announced as a center grant recipient . sahra , a somali refugee , left her home at 14 years old . throughout her journey in search of asylum , she managed to overcome dangers and discomforts . but she never gave up , and she continuously reminded herself to keep going . she 's the focus of ines dumig 's photo series `` apart together . '' dumig met sahra through a photo workshop at refugio , a shelter in munich , germany , for refugees and torture victims . what drew dumig to sahra specifically was her strength and her ability to effectively reflect on all of her experiences . `` it really impressed me how she deals with everything , '' dumig said . `` she 's strong in her way of connecting with the culture here and also reflecting on what happened , the culture where she comes from . '' the number of refugees seeking asylum in the european union increased by 25 % last year , with germany receiving the most applications . one of the reasons dumig decided to photograph sahra is because growing up in germany made dumig realize that she lived a fortunate lifestyle . another reason has to do with dumig 's interest in people 's emotions and finding one 's identity . `` i realized so many people want to come to europe , and i always had the feeling to disappear or to go away , '' dumig said . `` seeing how people live in other parts of the world made me realize how privileged i am . '' `` apart together '' serves not only as a documentation of sahra , but as a far-reaching story about people from all backgrounds . the title of dumig 's work refers to the fact that although people may be physically apart from one another , the comparable feelings they experience are what link all people together . `` sometimes we feel strong , sometimes we feel lost -- that 's kind of universal , i think , '' dumig said . `` that 's why i want to universalize ( sahra 's ) story as well , not only make it about her . '' the underlying themes of `` apart together '' include the feelings of isolation and `` otherness '' and the search for a valuable human dignity . social media . follow @ cnnphotos on twitter to join the conversation about photography . `` every one of these ( refugees ) have strong stories , and in the bureaucratic system , they are just a number or a document , '' dumig said . `` but they are a person , they are people with emotions and lives . '' sahra is currently under the status of `` suspension of deportation , '' meaning german immigration officials may grant her discretionary relief from deportation . dumig describes sahra as someone living through an unresolved situation . regardless of the challenges sahra faces as a refugee in germany , she is a survivor and the embodiment of resilience , determined to establish a new life for herself . she has learned to speak german fluently , and she has started working in the nation as well . like an unsolved photographic puzzle , each photo within `` apart together '' provides a piece of insight into sahra 's experiences . there is no certain and clear way in which to arrange the pieces , because they are a representation of the fragmented nature of sahra 's life . many of dumig 's photos are not of sahra herself , but instead show her surroundings . this makes `` apart together '' rich in symbolism and challenges viewers to develop their own perceptions . the photos are powerful because of this symbolic nature , as there are infinite interpretations attached to each one . `` i think everyone interprets by themselves , by however way they perceive it through their own experience . that 's up to the viewer , '' dumig said . `` it depends on who looks at the pictures . ... everyone will see something different . '' `` apart together '' allowed dumig to share various special moments with sahra , and they were both able to learn from each other . `` it was just something we both got something out of , '' dumig said . ines dumig is a photographer based in germany .
