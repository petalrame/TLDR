sanaa , yemen ( cnn ) al qaeda fighters attacked a prison in the coastal yemeni city of al mukallah early thursday , freeing at least 270 prisoners , a third of whom have al qaeda links , a senior defense ministry official has told cnn . khaled batarfi , a senior al qaeda figure , was among the escapees , officials said . dozens of attackers took control of government buildings , including the city 's central prison , central bank and radio station during the assault early thursday , according to officials . government troops arrived early thursday and clashed with the al qaeda fighters , and most of the militants fled , the officials said . last month , hundreds of inmates escaped from al mansoorah central prison in aden after clashes between shiite houthi rebels and forces loyal to ousted sunni president abdu rabu mansour hadi . yemen has been descending into chaos in the weeks since shiite houthi rebels removed hadi , a sunni , from power . the sectarian nature of the conflict is drawing in regional rivals saudi arabia , which is predominately sunni -- and is the country to which hadi ultimately fled -- and iran , which is predominately shiite and supports the houthi rebels . because of that , the conflict in yemen risks becoming a proxy war in the struggle between the iranians and the saudis for preeminence in the middle east . the saudis have conducted airstrikes against the houthi rebels and could send in ground troops . but little is simple in the middle east . and while the conflict between the houthis and forces loyal to hadi rages in the western part of the country , where it has caused hundreds of civilian deaths , al qaeda in the arabian peninsula , or aqap , controls parts of eastern yemen . aqap is considered one of the most ruthless branches of the terrorist organization .
