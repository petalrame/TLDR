baghdad , iraq ( cnn ) hundreds of additional iraqi troops are being sent to reinforce colleagues who are trying to fend off isis ' attempt to overrun iraq 's largest oil refinery , a key paramilitary force said tuesday . the reinforcements come four days after isis began attacking northern iraq 's baiji oil refinery , a key strategic resource that has long been a target because the facility refines much of the fuel used by iraqis domestically . the additional troops came from camp speicher , a fortified iraqi base near the city of tikrit , according to the media office of the hasd al-shaabi militia . the reinforcements include two federal police regiments , an iraqi military quick reaction force battalion and a regiment from hasd al-shaabi , which is a predominantly shia militia that worked with the iraqi military as well as sunni fighters to liberate tikrit from isis about two weeks ago . isis launched an assault on the baiji oil refinery late saturday . by sunday , isis said its fighters were inside the refinery and controlled several buildings , but iraqi government security officials denied that claim and insisted that iraqi forces remained in full control . the hasd al-shaabi media office said tuesday that iraqi troops already at the refinery were holding their ground , preparing to push isis out of the facility entirely . the attack could have a significant effect if it damages oil fields or machinery . the refinery is 40 kilometers ( 25 miles ) from tikrit . cnn 's hamdi alkhshali reported from baghdad . cnn 's jason hanna wrote in atlanta . cnn 's arwa damon and catherine e. shoichet contributed to this report .
