( cnn ) wikileaks founder julian assange has agreed to be interviewed by swedish prosecutors in london , his lawyer in sweden told cnn . assange has been holed up in the ecuadorian embassy in london since june 2012 to avoid extradition to sweden , where prosecutors want to question him about 2010 allegations that he raped one woman and sexually molested another . according to the lawyer , thomas olsson , swedish prosecutors will now have to reach out to british and ecuadorian authorities to request permission to conduct the interview at the embassy . the prosecutors previously balked at coming to britain to question assange . however , some of the alleged crimes will be subject to a statute of limitations in august 2015 , according to a statement from marianne ny , the director of public prosecutions . ny explained the logic behind the swedish authorities ' change of approach in her statement . `` my view has always been that to perform an interview with him at the ecuadorian embassy in london would lower the quality of the interview , and that he would need to be present in sweden in any case should there be a trial in the future , '' ny said . `` this assessment remains unchanged . now that time is of the essence , i have viewed it therefore necessary to accept such deficiencies to the investigation and likewise take the risk that the interview does not move the case forward , particularly as there are no other measures on offer without assange being present in sweden . '' the australian national has not been charged and denies the claims . assange has said he fears sweden would extradite him to the united states , where he could face the death penalty if he is charged and convicted of publishing government secrets through wikileaks . ecuador granted assange political asylum in 2012 . cnn 's per nyberg contributed to this report .
