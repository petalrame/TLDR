'' but it was as mckenzie , the occasionally crusty paterfamilias on `` l.a. law , '' that he 's likely best remembered . 'l.a . law ' : sex , crime and the ' venus butterfly ' . mckenzie usually took a back seat to the younger , more glamorous characters on `` law , '' a steven bochco-created legal show that owed much to his previous hit , `` hill street blues . '' the employees of mckenzie , brackman , chaney and kuzak included harry hamlin 's smooth-talking michael kuzak , corbin bernsen 's skirt-chasing divorce attorney arnie becker and michele greene 's idealistic abby perkins . there was as much time devoted to bedroom activities as there was legal issues while the show bravely took on such topics as aids , child molestation and capital punishment . but mckenzie was the one who kept them in check while still encouraging their better instincts . ( alan rachins ' douglas brackman was the business guy . ) he was also involved in one of the show 's most surprising plot twists : a romantic affair with a rival , rosalind shays ( diana muldaur ) , who met with one of tv 's most shocking deaths -- plunging down an elevator shaft . dysart appeared in every episode of the show , which ran from 1986 to 1994 . after `` l.a. law '' ended , dysart took few roles , though he did return for an `` l.a. law '' reunion movie in 2002 . dysart 's other credits include 1971 's `` the hospital , '' 1975 's `` the day of the locust , '' 1979 's `` being there , '' john carpenter 's 1982 version of `` the thing , '' 1985 's `` the falcon and the snowman '' and 1987 's `` mask .
