( cnn ) sky watchers in western north america are in for a treat : a nearly five-minute total lunar eclipse this morning . here 's how it 's unfolding : it started at 3:16 a.m. pacific daylight time , when the moon began moving into earth 's shadow . for the next hour and 45 minutes , that shadow will move across the moon and engulf it at 4:58 a.m. pacific time . the total eclipse will only last four minutes and 43 seconds , and nasa says that makes it the shortest one of the century . watch it live on nasa tv . while people west of the mississippi river will have the best view , at least a partial eclipse will be visible across the nation . but sunrise will interrupt the show on the east coast . parts of south america , india , china and russia also will be able to see the eclipse , but it wo n't be visible in greenland , iceland , europe , africa or the middle east . a lunar eclipse happens when the sun , earth and moon form a straight line in space , with the earth smack in the middle . the sun shines on the earth and creates a shadow . as the moon moves deeper into that shadow , it appears to turn dark and may even appear to be a reddish color . why red ? because earth 's atmosphere is filtering out most of the blue light . some people have nicknamed the effect the `` blood moon . '' nasa says lunar eclipses typically happen at least twice a year , but this eclipse is the third in a series of four in a row , known as a `` tetrad . '' the first was on april 15 , 2014 . the second was in september 2014 , the next is saturday and there will be one more , on september 28 . if you want to learn more about the eclipse , nasa astronomer mitzi adams will take questions on twitter @ nasa_marshall . did you see the total lunar eclipse ? share your photos with cnn ireport .
