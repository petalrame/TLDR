( cnn ) another controversy has erupted from the press tour for the soon-to-be-blockbuster marvel 's `` avengers : age of ultron . '' after robert downey jr. walked out on an interview , his co-stars chris evans and jeremy renner found themselves in hot water wednesday over comments they made in a similar junket interview . when asked by digital spy about the character black widow 's flirtations with the other superheroes , renner responded `` she 's a slut , '' and evans , laughing , added that she is a `` complete whore . '' joking or not , fans on social media did n't take it lightly . by thursday , both actors apologized . cnn obtained a statement from renner saying , `` i am sorry that this tasteless joke about a fictional character offended anyone . it was not meant to be serious in any way . just poking fun during an exhausting and tedious press tour . '' evans also released a statement : `` yesterday we were asked about the rumors that black widow wanted to be in a relationship with both hawkeye and captain america . we answered in a very juvenile and offensive way that rightfully angered some fans . i regret it and sincerely apologize . '' many on social media accepted his apology , but thoughts on renner were mixed . with one week left until its release , the `` avengers '' might want to steer clear of controversy from here on out .
