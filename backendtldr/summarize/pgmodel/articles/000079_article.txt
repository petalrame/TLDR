( cnn ) sometimes the best ideas come from the bathroom . but gaioz nigalidze 's ideas from the loo were a little too good . the georgian chess grandmaster has been banned from the dubai open chess tournament after officials discovered he was darting to the toilet to consult his smartphone , which was logged onto a chess analysis app , the dubai chess and culture club said . nigalidze 's opponent , tigran petrosian of armenia , grew suspicious when nigalidze kept bolting to the restroom . `` the armenian noticed the georgian was oddly frequenting the toilet after each move during a crucial part of the game , '' the dubai chess and culture club said . when officials first checked nigalidze , they did n't find any device on him , the club said . but after looking into the bathroom stall he visited , they found the smartphone hidden in toilet paper . at first , nigalidze claimed the smartphone was n't his , the dubai chess organization said . but the phone was logged on to a social media network under his account . `` they also found his game being analyzed in one of the chess applications , '' the chess club said . the infraction has been reported to the international chess federation . the dubai tournament 's chief arbiter , mahdi abdul rahim , said players found guilty of cheating will be suspended for three years from all sanctioned tournaments and up to 15 years for a repeated offense , the chess and culture club said . but this would n't be an isolated case of cheating in high-stakes chess matches . in 2008 , an iranian player was banned from the dubai open after getting help from someone who was watching the game 's live broadcast and was sending suggestions via text messages , the dubai chess club said . nigalidze 's resume includes victories in the 2013 and 2014 georgian chess championships . it 's not clear how many times he went to the bathroom during those matches .
