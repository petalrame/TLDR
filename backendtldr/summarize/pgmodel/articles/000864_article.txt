( cnn ) caught up in a rip current while snorkeling at finn 's beach in bali , roxy walsh was holding on to some rocks when she spotted something special . engraved with the words , `` darling joe , happy 70th birthday 2009 . love jenny , '' the antique ring lodged in the rocks clearly meant something to both joe and jenny . but there were no other clues ( besides the fact that the words were written in english ) as to where the couple might live . when she returned home to palm beach , australia , walsh was determined to reunite the ring with its owner . she went to the 5,000 members of her company 's facebook page , kids in adelaide , to reunite joe and jenny with the ring . she also created a `` find joe and jenny '' page to track them down . `` hi all . it 's roxy here . this is a reaaaallyy long shot but would love some share love on this post to help find joe . found this gold ring snorkeling at finns beach in bali today . it 's got a family crest on it , and engraved with the message ' darling joe , happy 70th birthday 2009 . love jenny ' how amazing would it be to find him ! please click share . '' the post got shared all over the world . nine months earlier , joe langley had been snorkeling in the same spot in bali when he lost the ring , which his wife , jenny , had purchased an antique store and had engraved for his birthday . `` i went for a swim , got caught in a rip , decided the rip was going to take me and finished up on the rocks , '' langley told sunshine coast daily . `` in clawing my way over the rocks , the ring pulled off my finger . '' the langleys ' 19-year-old granddaughter saw the facebook post april 9 and made the connection . it turns out that the langleys are fellow australians , living in the town of noosa , just three hours from where walsh lives in palm beach . walsh had the ring professionally cleaned before she met the happy langleys in noosa to return it .
