( cnn ) '' it 's showtime ! '' michael keaton paid homage -- ever so slightly -- to his roles in `` beetlejuice '' and `` batman '' in his third turn hosting `` saturday night live '' this weekend . keaton acknowledged in his opening monologue that a lot has changed since he first hosted the comedy sketch show in 1982 . `` i had a baby -- he 's 31 . i also have a new girlfriend -- she 's 28 , '' he said . fans who were hoping for a full-blown revival of keaton 's most memorable characters might have been a little disappointed . snl cast members taran killam and bobby moynihan begged the actor with a song to `` play '' batman and beetlejuice with them . all they got in response were a couple of one-liners . overall , keaton 's performance drew high marks from viewers and critics for its `` deadpan '' manner and `` unpredictable weirdness , '' in the words of a.v . club 's dennis perkins . fans also delighted in a cameo from `` walking dead '' star norman reedus during weekend update . keaton scored some laughs from the audience as an ad executive who 's not very good at his job , a confused grandfather and a high school teacher who gets asked to the prom in a riff on the romantic comedy `` she 's all that . '' other crowd-pleasing spots included a scientology parody music video and a news conference spoofing the ncaa student-athlete debate . the show also poked fun at cnn with cast member cecily strong playing anchor brooke baldwin . baldwin said on twitter that she 's taking it as a `` crazy compliment '' and shared a clip from the skit .
