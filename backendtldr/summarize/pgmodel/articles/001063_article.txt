( cnn ) amy schumer seems to be trying single-handedly this week to make everyone in america laugh . and she 's off to a good start . the comedian took a fake tumble on the red carpet tuesday night at the 2015 time 100 gala in new york -- right in front of fellow honorees kanye west and kim kardashian , who stepped around her as they moved down the line . the stunt drew guffaws from the paparazzi and other onlookers , although kanye -- perhaps not used to being upstaged -- looked unamused . `` i saw them , and i asked my publicist , ' can i dive in front of them and act like i fell ? ' and she said , ' i ca n't stop you , ' `` schumer told people . the prank came the same night the third season of schumer 's hit show , `` inside amy schumer , '' premiered on comedy central . the episode has won praise for its `` milk milk lemonade '' video , which ridicules mens ' obsession with a certain female body part , and a `` friday night lights '' parody in which high school football players protest their new coach 's `` no raping '' policy . and it came the night after schumer appeared on cbs ' `` the late show '' and turned david letterman red-faced when she lifted her dress to show him a scar she got from surfing and said , `` that 's my vagina . '' letterman , who had urged her to `` do something now that you 'll regret , '' turned to the chortling audience and said , `` well , i asked for it , did n't i ? '' so yes , you can say schumer -- who in the past two weeks has graced the cover of entertainment weekly , hosted the mtv movie awards and learned her tv show was just renewed for a fourth season -- is having a moment . `` they were right there ! the epicenter of american ( celebrity culture . ) got ta do it , '' schumer told people about her kimye red carpet dive . `` it was the best .
