( cnn ) chile 's calbuco volcano erupted twice in 24 hours , the country 's national geology and mining service said early thursday . the agency said it was evaluating the spectacular nighttime eruption , but indicated it was `` stronger than the first one . '' about 23½ inches ( 60 centimeters ) of ash fell in some places , according to the ministry of interior and public safety . authorities issued a red alert for the towns of puerto montt and puerto varas in southern chile . both are popular tourist destinations . a 12-mile ( 20 kilometer ) exclusion zone was established around the crater . military and police forces were assisting with the evacuations of more than 4,400 residents , the interior ministry said . the first eruption on wednesday set off a bit of a panic in the region . `` at the beginning , it was small , and later , the cloud grew and later there was a huge cloud over you and true terror starts , '' said one puerto montt resident . another person said : `` it was impressive to see an enormous mushroom cloud , with the immense force of the volcano , and to see the ashes . at that point , there was a lot of panic , lots of chaos , traffic jams , people going to supermarkets , everyone looking for water , trying to take out money from the atms . '' the eruption is a first for many in the region . the last major eruption was 1962 . there was a minor eruption in 1972 . calbuco also belched out a bit of gas and smoke in 1996 . alejandro verges , regional director at the ministry of interior and public safety , said thursday afternoon that officials are concerned there might be a third eruption . `` the situation is relatively calm right now , although people are understandably anxious about what could happen tonight , '' he said . cnn 's shasta darlington and marilia brocchetto contributed to this report .
