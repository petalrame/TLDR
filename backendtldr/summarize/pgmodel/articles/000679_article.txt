new york ( cnn ) jake tapper is the next anchor of cnn 's sunday morning political interview program `` state of the union . '' cnn announced tapper 's promotion on friday morning . he will take over the program in june ; he 'll remain the channel 's chief washington correspondent and the anchor of the weekday afternoon newscast `` the lead . '' among his peers , tapper is seen as an authority on politics , something a program like `` state of the union '' demands . he received rave reviews when he was the interim anchor of abc 's sunday morning hour `` this week '' in 2010 . `` i could n't be more excited about this election season and the new platform i will have at cnn to cover it , '' tapper said in a statement . `` ' state of the union ' has a rich tradition and i hope to not only build on its history but expand the definition of what a sunday show can be . '' tapper thanked cnn worldwide ceo jeff zucker `` for the confidence he continues to show in me and to my colleagues at cnn for the incredible support on air and off that i 've received since beginning this adventure two years ago . '' tapper joined cnn from abc in 2013 to anchor `` the lead . '' on `` state of the union , '' he succeeds candy crowley , who signed off the program last december . a rotation of fill-in hosts have been anchoring the program this year . zucker announced tapper 's appointment on the network 's editorial conference call on friday morning . `` i am thrilled that jake will take on this additional role at such a pivotal time in the election cycle , '' zucker said in a statement . `` he has the perfect combination of skills that make him uniquely qualified -- he 's a relentless reporter , a gifted storyteller , and a terrific interviewer who does n't stop until he gets answers . we are lucky to have him on both ' the lead ' and ' state of the union . ' '' sunday political programs are among the most prestigious chairs at television networks . and changes are afoot : cbs is about to say goodbye to bob schieffer , the longtime moderator of `` face the nation , '' who will be succeeded by john dickerson in june . additionally , nbc replaced david gregory with chuck todd on the original sunday public affairs program , `` meet the press , '' last fall . with the anchor moves at the other networks , cnn may see an opportunity for what 's known in the industry as share-shifting -- viewers switching networks and sampling the new anchors . with his new position , tapper will become the second man to work weekdays and sunday mornings . abc 's george stephanopoulos is both a co-host of `` good morning america '' and the moderator of `` this week . '' there is precedent for this at cnn : for many years wolf blitzer anchored on the weekdays and led the sunday morning program `` late edition , '' the forerunner to `` state of the union . ''
