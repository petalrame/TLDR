( cnn ) for superhero fans , the cup runneth over . most of us know the members of the avengers by now : iron man , captain america , hulk and the rest , and the fact that a few more like quicksilver are joining the cast in the `` avengers : age of ultron '' sequel . but there was one character who remained a mystery : the vision , to be played by paul bettany . thus far , we 've only seen his eyes in a trailer . with less than a month to go before the movie hits theaters , marvel studios put all the speculation to rest with a poster featuring bettany as the heroic android , who was a member of the superhero group for many years in the comics . meanwhile , as many marvel fans know , thursday was the eve of the new netflix series `` daredevil , '' and after a photoshopped first look at charlie cox 's iconic red daredevil suit went out , marvel put out a video of the real one . not to be outdone , director bryan singer announced a new character for next year 's sequel `` x-men : apocalypse , '' by telling empire magazine that ben hardy would be playing the role of the winged mutant angel . he even had a photo to share . and thursday 's new super images were n't quite done , because the questions over how jamie bell 's rocky character the thing in the rebooted `` fantastic four '' movie ( out august 7 ) might look were also finally answered . and he looks ... pretty much like the thing we already knew ( but reportedly , cgi this time ) . within 24 hours , we got yet another indication that the superhero trend is n't going anywhere anytime soon ( and we did n't even talk about the new photo of ryan reynolds ' `` deadpool '' ) .
