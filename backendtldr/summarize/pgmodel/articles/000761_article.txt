( cnn ) it would be easy to laugh off vin diesel 's prediction that his film `` furious 7 '' will win an oscar next year , but not for the reason you might think . after all , the actor was serious when he recently told variety `` it will probably win best picture at the oscars , unless the oscars do n't want to be relevant ever . '' but rather than ignore it because it 's a glossy , blockbuster action film , some might argue that the movie goes against type for academy award nominated films because the cast is so diverse . `` furious 7 '' hits theaters friday , months after controversy was stirred about the lack of diversity at the oscars . there were no actors of color nominated and no women in the directing category , which was dominated by white males . mexican filmmaker alejandro gonzalez iñarritu went on to win best director for `` birdman . '' the lack of diversity was so glaring ( even with the mostly black cast of the movie `` selma , '' which received a nomination for best picture ) that it spurred the twitter hashtag `` # oscarssowhite . '' in contrast , `` furious 7 '' could n't be more racially and ethnically inclusive . the cast includes dwayne `` the rock '' johnson -- a samoan/black man -- black actors christopher `` ludacris '' bridges and tyrese gibson , hispanic performer michelle rodriguez , thai martial artist tony jaa , beninese expatriate djimon hounsou and the late paul walker , a blue-eyed , blond-haired california native . the filmmakers even went so far as to make sure casting directors in abu dhabi and dubai , where key scenes were filmed , found diverse extras . `` we were mainly looking for the diverse look of the ( united arab emirates ) , '' miranda davidson , owner of the casting company , told the national . `` they really wanted to make sure we reflected the international feel of the country . '' almost since the beginning , the `` fast and furious '' films have had a diverse focus and appeal . the band of street racers , which encompassed white , black , asian , hispanic , male and female and bond as a family , has done well at the box office with each iteration . in 2011 , then boston globe film critic wesley morris wrote , `` go on and laugh your benetton , kumbaya , kashi , quinoa laugh , but it 's true : the most progressive force in hollywood today is the ' fast and furious ' movies . '' `` they 're loud , ludicrous , and visually incoherent , '' he said . `` they 're also the last bunch of movies you 'd expect to see in the same sentence as ' incredibly important . ' but they are -- if only because they feature race as a fact of life as opposed to a social problem or an occasion for self-congratulation . ( and this does n't even account for the gay tension between the male leads , and the occasional crypto-lesbian make-out . ) '' according to the motion picture association of america 's 2014 theatrical market statistics report , while hispanics make up 17 % of the u.s. population they account for 25 % of frequent moviegoers . likewise , women make up 52 % of moviegoers . entertainment weekly points out that the film franchise is doing a much better job of reflecting its audience than others in hollywood . `` despite the films ' cumulative worldwide gross of almost $ 2.4 billion , their racial inclusiveness remains an outlier ; american movies are still overwhelmingly white , '' ew 's chris lee writes . `` according to ucla 's 2015 hollywood diversity report , a mere 16.7 % of 2013 films starred minorities in lead roles . '' at least one moviegoer tweeted that he appreciated the effort . diesel told ew the franchise has come a long way from the original 2001 film , which featured segregated gangs of racers pitted against each other . `` it does n't matter what nationality you are , '' the star said . `` as a member of the audience , you realize you can be a member of that ' family . ' that 's the beautiful thing about how the franchise has evolved . ''
