( cnn ) a longtime friend of joni mitchell has filed a legal petition seeking to be named the singer-songwriter 's conservator . mitchell , who was inducted into the rock and roll hall of fame in 1997 , was taken to ucla medical center a month ago after being found unconscious in her home . she remains at the hospital , according to leslie morris ' court petition filed april 28 . morris is described as mitchell 's friend of more than 44 years in the legal documents . whether the folk and jazz singer is conscious remains a matter of some confusion . in her april 28 petition , morris says mitchell is unconscious : `` at this time she ( mitchell ) remains unconscious and unable to make any responses , and is therefore unable to provide for any of her personal needs . '' but on mitchell 's website , a statement posted the same day that says it was approved by morris says mitchell is alert . `` contrary to rumors circulating on the internet today , joni is not in a coma . joni is still in the hospital -- but she comprehends , she 's alert , and she has her full senses . a full recovery is expected . the document obtained by a certain media outlet simply gives her longtime friend leslie morris the authority -- in the absence of 24-hour doctor care -- to make care decisions for joni once she leaves the hospital . '' when asked about the discrepancy between statements about mitchell 's health on her website and in the legal filing , her publicist , alisse kingsley , responded that `` the website '' was accurate . a doctor 's capacity declaration stated that mitchell will likely be unable , due to her medical condition , to attend any court hearings for the next four to six months . adoring fans are posting their tributes to mitchell at weloveyoujoni.com . sonya hamasaki and cheri mossburg contributed to this report .
