caledonia , michigan ( cnn ) ben and shelby offrink met in college . it was n't the most romantic setting -- a study group for calculus-based physics -- but ben managed to turn it into a story worth telling by cheating . `` i set up a study group and ended up telling the other people not to come so it would be just the two of us , '' said ben with a smile . `` he was sneaky , '' says shelby . `` yeah , i wanted to meet her , '' says ben , `` and that was the best way i could figure out . '' fast-forward eight years to 2014 . ben , now 34 , and shelby , a newly minted 30-year-old , were married and raising little maeve , 3 , and baby hazel , 3 months , in caledonia , michigan , when life suddenly turns upside down . `` i thought it was sciatica , '' shelby says of the back pain and the `` odd '' feeling that prompted her to go to the hospital . `` but i could n't get the doctors in the er to pay attention . so i went back the next day and told them that i was incontinent , and they did an mri and there it was . '' `` it '' turned out to be an intramedullary glioblastoma , a highly aggressive form of brain cancer . shelby 's version was extremely rare because it was lodged in her spine instead of her brain . `` so it 's actually tangled into the spinal cord itself , '' ben explains . `` if you 'd imagine a meatball inside of bunch of spaghetti , you ca n't just easily take it out without damaging a bunch of the spinal cord itself . '' surgery removed 75 % . the rest was treated with a combination of oral chemo and radiation . but suddenly a second spot above the first grew worse and the area of radiation had to be broadened . after a week of treatment , shelby suddenly lost feeling in her legs . unfortunately , the numbness became permanent . before long , shelby was paralyzed from the belly button down . but that did n't stop her fighting spirit or her sense of humor . shelby nicknamed her tumors and decided to `` terminate '' them . `` you pronounce it as ' tumah tumah-nator , ' '' ben says . `` like how arnold schwarzenegger would say it if he had a tumor . '' as shelby continued to fight and improve , in august 2014 , ben got some terrible news . the hodgkins lymphoma he had fought and battled into remission when he was 20 had reappeared . and it probably had been hiding in his body for a few years , making it extremely hard to overcome . `` i thought it was never a concern again , '' ben says . `` the procedures i went through , having a bone marrow transplant , i thought there would n't be any issues . it 's been over 15 years . it caught everyone completely off guard . '' ben was slated for a clinical trial with an experimental drug , but his alkaline phosphate levels were too high to meet the requirements . with no other options in the grand rapids , ann arbor or detroit areas , he is now on generalized chemotherapy , hoping it will force the cancer into remission so he can undergo a bone marrow transplant . two donors have been found that are a perfect match , if the cancer will respond . `` as it goes on , they are saying it 's getting harder and harder to treat , '' he says . `` it 's just like a car picking up speed . eventually you 're going to have 5 million cells , it 's just going to keep growing and growing . '' suddenly , both parents were undergoing the nausea , fatigue and discomfort of chemotherapy while trying to raise two small children . `` some days it does feel like a battle , '' ben admits . `` the days you are feeling absolutely horrible you do n't even want to get out of bed , but you know you have to because you have to take care of the girls or help shelby . some days it 's just way tougher than others . '' friends and family became critical to the family 's success , taking over updates to the family 's online journal , and running fundraisers for medical expenses and building supplies to make the house wheelchair-friendly . `` we 'd had an amazing support group , '' ben says . `` shelby has friends from high school who will drop everything to help us out at a moment 's notice . and the community , it 's just amazing for people to help that much . `` `` even outside of our community , people we do n't even know , '' adds shelby , wiping a tear from her eye . `` we 've had care packages sent from ireland , sweden and australia . it means a lot . '' this january came the worst news yet . shelby 's cancer , which had retreated from her spine , suddenly appeared in her brain . three tumors . inoperable . what is shelby 's reaction ? `` i 'm not giving up , '' she says . `` ben and i have a long road ahead of us . we know it 's going to be hard , but we 're going to do it . '' `` for me it 's just something that you have to do , '' ben says . `` you have to fight it and you have to beat it because there is no option . '' maeve , who is 4 years old now , and hazel , 1 , will have a home with ben 's brother if the worst is to happen , and friends are setting up fundraisers for the girls ' education . but that 's not the focus of ben and shelby 's fight . they want to get well . `` yeah , we have two little ladies we have to take care of , '' shelby says , `` and lots of family and friends that care about us . '' `` she 's not just doing it for herself , she 's doing it for her whole family , especially her girls and her husband , ben , '' said jay tomczak , shelby 's older brother . `` she 's not going to ever give up . what we really need is hope . '' the offrinks would like help finding clinical trials to address the rare cancers they are fighting , as well as access to cancer centers with more advanced techniques than are available in michigan . `` we 're going to get all of our information and would like to go to harvard or mayo ( clinic ) or places where maybe they do have more experience , and act in a shorter time frame , '' shelby says . `` if , right now , we can find two or three trials that maybe shelby can get into , or a trial drug for me to try instead of the path i 'm on right now , it could definitely benefit us , '' adds ben . `` we just ca n't wait , '' shelby says . her prognosis is about six months , she says , and a year for her husband . `` never give up , because there 's no reason to . just keep fighting , '' shelby says . she breaks into tears : `` especially when you have someone special to fight for and everyone has someone special to fight for -- there 's no one who does n't .
