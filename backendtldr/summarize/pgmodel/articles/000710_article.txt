( cnn ) was it politics or something else ? no one is sure , but the headstone of hillary clinton 's father , hugh rodham , was found tipped over this week , just a couple of days after she announced her run for the white house . `` it was just laying down just right like that , boom , '' paul mcgloin told cnn affiliate wnep . `` i pass here five , six times a day because i live two blocks from here and when i looked i could n't believe it , to see that it was tipped over . '' mcgloin said he 's tended to the grave site at the washburn street cemetery in scranton , pennsylvania , since rodham was buried there in 1993 . police are investigating , but no other headstones were knocked over . police chief carl graziano told the scranton times-tribune that he suspects vandalism . `` i 'm not sure how else it would have fallen over , '' he said . still , police will look into the possibility that it was weather-related . funeral director neil regan also said vandalism is the most-likely cause , not the weather . `` the more i thought about it , there were no serious winds or weather events , '' he said . `` paul mcgloin told me he had driven by here 8 o'clock ( monday ) morning and the stone was in place . '' mcgloin believes it 's no coincidence that it happened within days of clinton announcing her second presidential bid . `` and all of a sudden the headstone is tipped over , two days later , '' he said . `` as long as i`ve been coming here , the headstone has been pretty secure around the base of it . '' cnn 's greg morrison contributed to this report .
