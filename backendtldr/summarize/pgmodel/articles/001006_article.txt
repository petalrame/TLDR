( cnn ) like phone booths and typewriters , record stores are a vanishing breed -- another victim of the digital age . camelot music . virgin megastores . wherehouse music . tower records . all of them gone . corporate america has largely abandoned brick-and-mortar music retailing to a scattering of independent stores , many of them in scruffy urban neighborhoods . and that 's not necessarily a bad thing . yes , it 's harder in the spotify era to find a place to go buy physical music . but many of the remaining record stores are succeeding -- even thriving -- by catering to a passionate core of customers and collectors . on saturday , hundreds of music retailers will hold events to commemorate record store day , an annual celebration of , well , your neighborhood record store . many stores will host live performances , drawings , book signings , special sales of rare or autographed vinyl and other happenings . some will even serve beer . to their diehard customers , these places are more than mere stores : they are cultural institutions that celebrate music history ( the entire duran duran oeuvre , all in one place ! ) , display artifacts ( aretha franklin on vinyl ! ) , and nurture the local music scene ( hey , here 's a cd by your brother 's metal band ! ) . they also employ knowledgeable clerks who will be happy to debate the relative merits of `` blood on the tracks '' and `` blonde on blonde . '' or maybe , like jack black in `` high fidelity , '' just mock your lousy taste in music . so if you 're a music geek , drop by . but you might think twice before asking if they stock `` i just called to say i love you .
