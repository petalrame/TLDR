( cnn ) if newly revised nypd training materials are approved by a federal judge , new cadets could be taking courses reminding them `` not to engage in racial profiling . '' the proposed training materials , overseen by appointed federal monitor peter zimroth , were submitted to manhattan federal court judge analisa torres on monday for approval . they include directives to `` not tell or tolerate ethnic , racial or sexist jokes '' and to `` not imitate the speech patterns '' of others . `` do not engage in racial profiling , '' the training materials read . `` it is against the law . it violates fundamental democratic precepts and freedoms . it violates this department 's policies . it is offensive . it violates your responsibility to treat people equally . it diverts us from catching real criminals . it alienates us from people who need us , and hurts our ability to do our job . you can probably think of other reasons not to do it , but the point is that you will not do it . '' the training notes also instruct new cadets `` not to use terms or words that devalue groups of people or stereotype them '' and `` not to imitate speech patterns of other racial , ethnic and class groups when communicating cross culturally '' because `` they appear disingenuous , artificial , and possibly racist . '' the revised training notes , which include 140 pages of instruction and powerpoint slides , are a result of a 2013 federal ruling declaring the new york police department 's `` stop , question and frisk '' practice unconstitutional . the nypd has said the policy -- in which police stop , question and frisk people they consider suspicious -- was used to deter crime . the practice had been widely criticized . police department figures showed that nearly nine out of 10 people `` stopped and frisked '' in 2011 were african-american or hispanic , though new york mayor bill de blasio has said 90 % of those stopped were innocent . `` the current training materials had not undergone a comprehensive review for some time ... [ and ] did not address some important subjects or account for some changes in nypd policies and law , '' zimroth wrote in a cover letter to torres . `` all parties agreed it was essential that the materials be rewritten for the current class to reflect current law and policy . '' the nypd collaborated with zimroth 's team in crafting the final training materials . they will now `` review their implementation in terms of our current and ongoing practices , '' said an nypd spokesperson in an email to cnn . the patrolmen 's benevolent association declined to comment . the materials also provide historical legal information on proper `` stops '' and offers detailed procedures for patrolling buildings for criminal activity . they also give instructions on how an officer should lawfully conduct him or herself when engaging with the public . `` remember that a courteous , professional and respectful police officer who illustrates the opposite of bias and discrimination helps create a partnership with the community and builds rapport with the people in it . `` the result is that the citizens become our allies and , in turn , policing becomes safer and easier . this enhances our effectiveness and increases our pride and pleasure in what we do , '' the notes read . if approved , the new training materials will be integrated into the class curriculum for the current class of cadets . they are expected to graduate in june .
