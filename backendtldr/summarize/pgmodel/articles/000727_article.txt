( cnn ) a family trip to a nebraska zoo turned terrifying for one family after the gorilla they were looking at leaped toward the exhibit window , cracking it . kevin cave caught the incident on video that he posted on his reddit page . it has already been viewed more than 1 million times . cave said when his family first arrived at omaha 's henry doorly zoo gorilla exhibit , he noticed one of the gorillas had a cut below his eye that was `` bleeding a little bit . '' he said he overheard a couple of zookeepers say the gorillas had been fighting with one another . then the gorilla -- named kijoto -- charged toward the window and smacked into it , he said . the leap sent the family and other patrons running , but cave said when he looked back , `` it was n't as bad as we thought it was . '' dan cassidy with the henry doorly zoo said he 's been surprised by the attention since he considered the whole thing a `` nonevent . '' the group of male gorillas is known to have occasional skirmishes . `` they show how tough they are by pounding on the wall and the windows , '' cassidy said . even with the crack , the public was never in danger , he said , because the window has multiple layers of both glass and acrylic . kijoto is a 20-year-old western lowland gorilla , according to a release on the zoo 's website . he weighs 375 pounds .
