irbil , iraq ( cnn ) isis claimed it controlled part of iraq 's largest oil refinery sunday , posting images online that purported to show the storming of the facility , fierce clashes and plumes of smoke rising above the contested site . the group said it launched an assault on the baiji oil refinery late saturday . by sunday , isis said its fighters were inside the refinery and controlled several buildings , but iraqi government security officials denied that claim and insisted iraqi forces remain in full control . cnn could n't independently verify isis ' claim . it would n't be the first time that militants and iraqi forces have battled over the refinery , a key strategic resource that has long been a lucrative target because the facility refines much of the fuel used by iraqis domestically . if an attack damaged oil fields or machinery , it could have a significant impact . the refinery is just 40 kilometers ( 25 miles ) from the northern iraqi city of tikrit , which iraqi forces and shiite militias wrested from isis less than two weeks ago . cnn 's jennifer deaton and catherine e. shoichet contributed to this report .
