( cnn ) '' a long , long , time ago ... '' those five words , when uttered or sung , makes baby boomers immediately think of don mclean 's pop masterpiece `` american pie . '' it 's hard to believe that his phenomenal 8½ minute allegory , which millions of americans know by heart , is 44 years old . all sorts of historical cross-currents play off each other in this timeless song , brilliantly gilded with the unforgettable chorus , which starts as `` bye , bye , miss american pie . '' there is no real way to categorize mclean 's `` american pie '' for its hybrid of modern poetry and folk ballad , beer-hall chant and high-art rock . on tuesday , christie 's sold the 16-page handwritten manuscript of the song 's lyrics for $ 1.2 million to an unnamed buyer . mclean was a paperboy when , on february 3 , 1959 , he saw that buddy holly , ritchie valens and j.p. `` the big bopper '' richardson had been tragically killed in an airplane crash in clear lake , iowa . `` the next day i went to school in shock and guess what ? '' mclean recalled . `` nobody cared . rock ' n ' roll in those days was sort of like hula hoops and buddy had n't had a big hit on the charts since '57 . '' by cathartically writing `` american pie , '' mclean has guaranteed that the memory of those great musicians lives forever . having recorded his first album , `` tapestry , '' in 1969 , in berkeley , california , during the student riots , mclean , a native new yorker , became a kind of weather vane for what he called the `` generation lost in space . '' when his cultural anthem `` american pie '' was released in november 1971 , it replaced bob dylan 's `` the times they are a changin '' as the peoples almanac of the new decade . it 's important to think of `` american pie '' as one would of henry longfellow 's `` evangeline '' or johnny mercer 's `` moon river '' -- an essential americana poem emanating wistful recollection , blues valentine , and youthful protest rolled into one . there is magic brewing in the music and words of `` american pie , '' for mclean 's lyrics and melody frame a cosmic dream , like those jack kerouac tried to conjure in his poetry-infused novel `` on the road . '' don mclean : buddy holly , rest in peace . influenced by pete seeger and the weavers , mclean proudly wore the mantle of troubadour in the early 1970s , when `` american pie '' topped the billboard charts , and has never shed the cape . wandering far and wide , singing `` american pie '' at windblown dance halls in wyoming and cloistered colleges in new england , at huge amphitheaters in california and little coffee houses in the hudson river valley , mclean has performed his global anthem thousands of times . yet the encore number never loses its transfixing allure . when mclean prods audiences by rhapsodizing `` and they were singing '' everybody spontaneously joins in with the `` bye , bye '' chorus . watching mclean deliver his most notable song in concert is to take part in a collective happening . what makes `` american pie '' so unusual is that it is n't a relic from the counterculture but a talisman , which , like a sacred river , keeps bringing joy to listeners everywhere . when `` american pie '' suddenly is played on a jukebox or radio it 's almost impossible not to sing along . like `` danny boy '' or `` streets of laredo '' or `` shenandoah , '' it 's eternal . with illusions to football fields and rock ' n ' roll , river levees and nursery rhymes , the song cascades along like a boat going down niagara falls or a roller coaster that jumps tracks but floats instead of crashes . after all these years , `` american pie '' still makes me feel empowered and yet filled with a sense of loss . the song is alive and joyful , yet fretful about a world gone wrong . it is a song that will never die . a reverie for the ages . there is a jump to the chorus , which forces the mind to relive the '50s , '60s and '70s , to troll through the back pages of our lives while , like a traditional irish folksong , it reminds us of fate . while mclean , the muse , has rightfully not tried to interpret `` american pie , '' it 's fair to surmise that `` the king '' is elvis presley , `` helter skelter '' refers to the charles manson murders , the `` jester on the sidelines in a cast '' is bob dylan , and `` jack flash '' the rolling stones . but who knows ? the lyric remains a puzzle open to thousands of spirited interpretations . as a literary artifact of the early 1970s , there is n't anything to compare to `` american pie . '' normally , i do n't like rankings of literature or songs or even presidents , for that matter . but the fact that the recording industry of america and the national endowment of the arts chose `` american pie '' as the fifth greatest song of the 20th century speaks to the composition 's importance as an enduring piece of pop art . the other four were `` over the rainbow '' ( by harold arlen and e.y `` yip '' harburg ) , `` white christmas `` ( by irving berlin ) , `` this land is your land '' ( by woody guthrie ) and `` respect '' ( by otis redding ) . that is fine company . quite simply , `` american pie '' is one of the greatest songs ever written . and tuesday the original lyrics found a new home .
