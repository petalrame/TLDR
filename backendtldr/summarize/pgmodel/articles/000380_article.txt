( cnn ) a fiery sunset greeted people in washington sunday . the deep reddish color caught seattle native tim durkan 's eye . he photographed a handful of aerial shots of the sunset warming the city 's skyline and shared them on cnn ireport . the stunning sunsets were the result of raging wildfires in parts of siberia . `` the dramatic sunsets began showing up over the weekend and had seattle locals wondering where the amber-colored haze was originating from , '' durken said . the fires were started in southeastern siberia , by farmers burning grass in their fields . but on april 14 , it is believed that the flames quickly grew out of control because of strong winds and spread throughout the region , according to cnn affiliate komo-tv . as a result , the fires have destroyed dozens of villages in the region . rescue crews were able to put out the flames . however , the lingering smoke from the widespread fires were picked up by atmospheric winds . the winds carried the smoke from siberia across the pacific ocean and brought it to the pacific northwest . parts of oregon , washington and british columbia are seeing the results of the smoke , wind and solar light combination . the reason people are seeing an intense red sunset is a result of smoke particles filtering out the shorter wavelength colors from the sunlight like greens , blues , yellows and purples , komo-tv said . that means colors like red and orange are able to penetrate the air unfiltered . the colors are especially intense during sunrises and sunsets because there is more atmosphere for the light to travel through to get to a person 's eye . as the smoke starts to dissipate , air quality will get better and these fiery sunsets will lose their reddish hue .
