( cnn ) monty python in a movie ? what a silly idea . but the timing was right for the gang of british comedians ( along with their token american , terry gilliam ) , who were looking to hit the big screen after four seasons of `` monty python 's flying circus , '' their groundbreaking british tv series . `` monty python and the holy grail , '' which premiered 40 years ago thursday , was the result . the movie , a spoof of the arthurian legend , did not start auspiciously . the budget was small -- about $ 400,000 , half of it supplied by rock stars , including genesis and pink floyd . on the first day of filming in scotland -- the first shot , in fact -- the camera broke . the weather was bad . the hotel was dismal . python member graham chapman was suffering from alcohol withdrawal . it got better . on the day of its first american screening in new york , a thousand people were in line by 8 a.m . thanks to the popularity of `` python '' on american tv , the movie was a box-office hit , making $ 5 million -- more than 10 times its budget . more importantly , it soon became a comedy classic . the dialogue alone has been widely quoted , with such lines as `` it 's just a flesh wound '' and `` your mother was a hamster and your father smelt of elderberries '' referenced on shows such as `` the simpsons , '' `` game of thrones '' and `` the blacklist . '' python member eric idle turned the film into the tony-winning broadway play `` spamalot . '' the troupe ended up making three movies -- well , four , if you count `` and now for something completely different , '' five if you include `` monty python live at the hollywood bowl , '' five-and-a-half if you allow `` the rutles , '' six if you ... well , three . we 'll say three . is there a best one ? where should you start ? let 's break them down : from its dramatic opening credits featuring fake-swedish subtitles to the adventures of sir launcelot ( `` the boldest and most expensive of the knights '' ) , weighted-bird computations and sudden animator heart attacks , `` holy grail '' is probably the loosest and most python-esque of the python oeuvre . as a movie with a plot and character and all that movie nonsense , it falls short -- but as a repository for some of python 's best gags , it remains perhaps the best ( and certainly most quotable ) of the bunch . besides , it features the word `` shrubbery . '' `` ' grail ' is a bit like ' a hard day 's night , ' `` idle observed in the pythons ' autobiography . `` it 's got a joie de vivre that 's very infectious , it 's very hard not to like . '' pros : the dialogue . the black knight . the knights who say `` ni . '' cons : it 's sometimes sloppy . and it does n't really have an ending . verdict : better than a cheese shop full of ex-parrots . probably python 's most consistent movie , `` life of brian '' is the story of a guy born down the road from jesus who finds himself hailed as a messiah and ends up crucified . it was a satire on organized religion , first-century politics and zealotry -- one of the best bits is the ongoing argument between `` the people 's front of judea '' and `` the judean people 's front '' -- but try telling that to the protesters . the film was picketed in cities across the united states , deplored by some religious leaders and banned in ireland and norway . ( sweden promoted it with the line , `` the film so funny that it was banned in norway . '' ) it did have one huge supporter : ex-beatle george harrison , who mortgaged his estate to help fund the movie when a financier pulled out . `` he paid for it because he wanted to see it , '' idle recalled . `` the most anybody 's ever paid for a cinema ticket in history . '' pros : graham chapman 's performance as brian . `` what have the romans ever done for us ? '' `` always look on the bright side of life . '' cons : the adventurous but ultimately pointless animated-alien scene . michael palin 's lisping pilate ( though , to be fair , it 's so childishly broad you ca n't help but laugh ) . verdict : funnier than the spanish inquisition . `` meaning of life , '' constructed as a series of sketches , is the most uneven of the three narrative python films . after the stunning opening sequence , gilliam 's `` the crimson permanent assurance '' -- about the revenge of some pirate-like accountants -- the film struggles to find its footing . even the pythons thought so . `` the rhythms were n't right , '' said gilliam . `` it needed a whole other rewrite , '' said idle . nevertheless , it has its moments : the `` every sperm is sacred '' sequence , about religion , sex and contraception ; the organ donor who 's surprised by a demand for his liver ; and -- of course -- the infamous mr. creosote , the absurdly fat man who gorges on a monstrous meal at a posh restaurant , regurgitates it at length , and is then encouraged to have a `` wafer-thin '' after-dinner mint -- with disastrous results . it also has the sweetest of all python songs : idle 's `` the galaxy song , '' which is even more uplifting than `` brian 's '' `` always look on the bright side of life . '' not a bad conclusion , given what happened to mr. creosote . pros : `` permanent assurance . '' mr. creosote . `` the galaxy song . '' cons : the fish . the schoolmaster 's sex lesson . the fish . verdict : more enjoyable than watching the upper-class twit of the year competition .
