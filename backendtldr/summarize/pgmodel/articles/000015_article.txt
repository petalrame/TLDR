( hln ) hln 's # meforreal is an uplifting , revealing conversation about the way we present ourselves online . we want to see the real parts of life , the ones that do n't get a filter or a facebook post but are a part of our realities nonetheless . tag your favorite unscripted , unedited , un-perfected moments using # meforreal and see what others are sharing on facebook , twitter and the daily share . the internet is always quick to dish out judgmental opinions , such as the body-hate people showed to singer p ! nk after she posted a photo of herself in a black dress she wore to a cancer benefit this past weekend ( which , if you ask us , was pretty fantastic , and she looked fabulous in it . ) as a woman with a lot of experience singing to her detractors , though , she knew exactly what to say and how to say it . and when it came to keeping her tongue firmly in cheek while she schooled people who had nothing better to do than be totally rude , she owned it . clearly , it 's not troubling p ! nk or her hubs , carey hart ( who , by the way , is quite handsome himself , so clearly he has rad taste ) . not only did p ! nk 's response rally her fans , but they also started sharing their own photos of themselves post-pregnancy and embracing what p ! nk tells her daughter is her `` squishiness . '' postscript for the haters : we think you just racked up more fans for p ! nk . now go look in a mirror , and tell us -- are you perfect ?
