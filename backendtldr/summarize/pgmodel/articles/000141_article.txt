' be the hot 100 's no . 1 song of 2015 ? with `` funk '' now just three weeks from potentially tying `` one sweet day '' for the record , and four weeks from possibly claiming it all to itself , can it rewrite hot 100 history ? it 's too early to forecast charts a month away , but `` funk '' still sports strong leads in all main hot 100 metrics . `` funk '' logs a 13th week atop the digital songs chart with 165,000 downloads sold ( down 12 percent ) in the week ending march 29 , according to nielsen music . that 's a record-tying feat : `` funk ! '' matches flo rida 's 2007-08 hit `` low , '' featuring t-pain , for the most weeks a title has spent at no . 1 on digital songs . `` funk '' also leads streaming songs ( 16.2 million u.s. streams , down 15 percent ) for an 11th week . on radio songs , `` funk '' reigns for a 10th week with 166 million in all-format audience ( down 4 percent ) . it 's the first song to reach double-digit weeks at no . 1 on radio songs since `` blurred lines '' led for 11 . ask billboard : will ' uptown funk ! ' be the hot 100 's no . 1 song of 2015 ? `` funk , '' thus , leads the hot 100 and its three main component charts ( digital songs , radio songs and streaming songs ) simultaneously for a record-extending ninth week ( nonconsecutively ) . perhaps helping the chances that `` funk '' can remain at no . 1 on the hot 100 , at least for another week : while it 's down by 11 percent in overall activity , the no . 2 song ( for a third week ) , maroon 5 's `` sugar , '' decreases by 3 percent , while ed sheeran 's `` thinking out loud , '' at no . 3 ( for a third week , after peaking at no . 2 for eight weeks ) , is off by 2 percent . and , the lead of `` funk '' over those songs is still significant : they each boast approximately two-thirds of the hot 100 points of `` funk '' this week . could either `` sugar '' or `` loud '' rebound to challenge `` funk '' further on the hot 100 ? could another song in the top 10 topple it ? or , is it a song just building , or not even yet released , that will take over ? again , it 's too soon to tell . we know only that a song will eventually dethrone the uncommonly overarching smash that `` funk '' has become . ( at least we think one will ... ) chart highlights : taylor swift 's ' style ' hits no . 1 on adult pop songs . meanwhile , `` sugar '' takes over at no . 1 on the subscription services-based on-demand songs chart , despite a 10 percent drop to 4.1 million streams .
