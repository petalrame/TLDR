( cnn ) a term used by president barack obama and baltimore mayor stephanie rawlings-blake to characterize rioters has given new life to a debate over the word `` thug . '' `` of course it 's not the right word , to call our children ' thugs , ' '' baltimore city councilman carl stokes told cnn 's `` erin burnett outfront . '' `` these are children who have been set aside , marginalized , who have not been engaged by us . no , we do n't have to call them thugs . '' `` just call them n -- -- -s. just call them n -- -- -s , '' he said . `` no , we do n't have to call them by names such as that . '' the rev . jamal bryant drew the same comparison wednesday morning on cnn . the president and the mayor are wrong , he said . `` these are not thugs , these are upset and frustrated children . '' `` it 's amazing . you do n't call six police officers who kill a man without probable cause ' thugs , ' but children who are frustrated and do n't have an outlet , you call them ' thugs . ' ' thugs ' is the 21st century word for the n-word . and it is repulsive and it is offensive to every person who is a parent trying to raise children interpreting what 's taking place in this hour . '' the recent unrest in baltimore was sparked by the arrest and death of freddie gray , who suffered a severe spinal cord injury while in custody . six officers have been suspended over the incident . bryant delivered the eulogy at gray 's funeral . what we know , do n't know about freddie gray 's death . mayor rawlings-blake responded wednesday . `` i wanted to clarify my comments on ' thugs , ' '' she wrote wednesday on twitter . `` when you speak out of frustration and anger , one can say things in a way that you do n't mean . '' she added , `` that night we saw misguided young people who need to be held accountable , but who also need support . and my comments then did n't convey that . '' kweisi mfume , baltimore native and former president of the naacp , said , `` it 's important we not shift the focus into something that has absolutely nothing to do with poverty , despair , hunger , homelessness and a sense of not belonging . '' `` whether we call them a thug , a law breaker , a juvenile delinquent , it really does n't matter . what matters is how do we take back our streets . and that 's what men have been doing , going around , talking to these young men where they , are in their face , and letting them know , you ca n't control this community . it is not yours . you ca n't burn it down . you ca n't force people out . you ca n't threaten people , '' he told `` outfront . '' `` so i understand that , that people want to talk about a word . but i 'm more worried about a movement , and it 's not necessarily a movement for positive change . it 's a movement for negative change right now unless we get it under control . '' kevin shird , another baltimore native and author of `` lessons of redemption , '' said `` thug '' is `` not like the n-word in my mind . '' but , he said in a cnn interview , the term has `` been racialized across america , so i can see why people would become offended like that . '' shird , a former drug dealer , also said he does not see the word as an accurate description of the young people who rioted and looted in baltimore on monday . `` these were young juveniles . and so , in my mind i do n't see a 16- or 17-year-old as a thug . i have seen thugs , and they do n't look like thugs to me . my experience in life has been a little bit more extreme than that , but , again , it was criminal behavior and it ca n't be justified . '' he added , `` we just want to stay focused on the issue of police brutality and of the freddie gray matter . '' opinion : calling people ' thugs ' solves nothing . nfl player richard sherman has previously called the term `` the accepted way of calling somebody the n-word nowadays . '' rapper slim thug once addressed the term on the houston radio program `` madd hatta morning show . '' the host set up the exchange by referring to deceased rapper tupac shakur . `` i got the tupac definition , '' the host said , as `` outfront '' reported online in january 2014 . `` his is just , you know , a person going through struggles , has gone through struggles and continue to live day-by-day ... . just trying to make it . `` `` i think the same thing , '' slim thug responded . `` i probably got ' thug ' off of him , you know , growing up listening to him ... i feel the same way that he felt , coming from nothing to something . '' webster 's dictionary defines `` thug '' as `` a brutal ruffian or assassin . '' on monday , mayor rawlings-blake said , `` there is a difference between what we saw over the past week with the peaceful protests , those who wish to seek justice , those who wish to be heard , and want answers , and the difference between those protests and the thugs who only want to incite violence and destroy our city . '' on tuesday , president obama referred to the rioters as `` a handful of criminals and thugs who tore up the place . '' that same day , u.s. secretary of state john kerry used the word `` thugs '' to refer to isis . at a luncheon in honor of japanese prime minister shinzo abe , kerry referred to two japanese citizens `` who were murdered by the thugs of daesh in retribution for japan 's pledge of humanitarian assistance -- i repeat , humanitarian assistance -- to the victims of fighting in the middle east . '' ( daesh is another term for isis . ) kerry has also referred to `` thugs '' in the ukraine crisis . obama has also used the term `` thugs '' in similar context . `` not every collection of thugs that labels themselves al qaeda will pose a credible threat to the united states , '' he said in one speech . complete coverage on the baltimore riots .
