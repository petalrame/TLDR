( the hollywood reporter ) it may be time to light the lights . abc is filming a proof of concept for a revival of `` the muppets , '' the hollywood reporter has learned . `` the big bang theory '' co-creator bill prady is co-writing the script for a pilot presentation that sources say could be unspooled at may 's upfront presentation to madison avenue advertisers . sources tell thr that the project , if all goes well , could go straight to series . bob kushell ( `` anger management , '' `` 3rd rock from the sun '' ) will also co-write and is attached to serve as showrunner , with wilfred 's randall einhorn attached to exec produce and direct the presentation . abc 's `` muppets '' revival is being produced by abc studios and the muppet studios , which disney owns . the presentation is set to film next weekend on the disney lot in burbank with some of the original muppet performers returning . sources say the concept for the presentation includes the regular cast of characters created by jim henson — kermit the frog , fozzie bear , gonzo and animal , among others — gathering at abc studios for a meeting about the new `` muppet show . '' however , the show wo n't move forward unless miss piggy signs on , and her current relationship with frequent love kermit is on the rocks , preventing the show from getting off the ground . early plans call for two celebrity cameos — including miss piggy 's current co-star — as well as new roles including fozzie 's girlfriend and her parents . for prady , the revived `` muppets '' — which landed at abc after initial interest from netflix — marks a return to his roots . the producer , who currently does not have an overall deal , started his career working for henson in 1982 and ultimately started writing for `` the jim henson hour , '' remaining on the series until a year after henson 's death in 1990 . this marks the second time prady has attempted to revive `` the muppets . '' the writer-producer shot some test footage before cbs ' `` the big bang theory '' that disney ultimately passed on . for his part , prady earned an emmy nomination in 1991 for writing tribute `` the muppets celebrate jim henson '' in 1990 and has contributed writing to disney 's muppet-themed attractions . should abc order `` muppets '' to series , prady would juggle both that project and cbs ' `` the big bang theory , '' which he exec produces . created in 1955 by henson , the original muppet characters appeared on `` sam and friends '' from 1955-61 before going on to appear on late-night talk shows and commercials and becoming a regular part of `` sesame street '' in 1969 . `` the muppet show '' launched on its own as a comedy-variety series and ran from 1976-81 , with kermit serving as the de-facto showrunner on the syndicated series that was produced out of the u.k . the franchise has spawned multiple movies ( 1979 's `` the muppet movie , '' 1981 's `` the great muppet caper , '' 1984 's `` the muppets take manhattan '' ) as well as nbc 's 1989 series `` the jim henson hour . '' following henson 's death , the franchise continued with `` muppets tonight '' airing on abc in 1996 with reruns airing on sibling disney channel from 1997-2000 . that was the last television series to feature the muppets characters . on the feature side , the franchise featured 1992 's `` the muppet christmas carol , '' 1996 's `` muppet treasure island '' and 1999 's `` muppets from space , '' the latter two of which were co-produced by disney , who acquired rights to the muppets in 2004 and formed the muppets studio . the company rebranded the franchise in 2008 with jason segel 's `` the muppets , '' with an eighth feature in the franchise , `` muppets most wanted '' bowing in 2014 . for abc , the muppets revival comes as variety shows are in the midst of a resurgence on the broadcast networks . nbc has made the format a priority , unspooling marlon wayans-hosted celebrity variety series `` i can do that ! '' in the summer and has neil patrick harris entry `` saturday night takeaway '' in the works . the decision to revive `` the muppets '' also comes as remakes and reboots are having their moment in the sun on the small-screen , as broadcast networks look to fan bases for existing franchises to help cut through the clutter and draw eyeballs in an increasingly crowded scripted space . on the comedy side , `` the muppets '' arrives as it has become increasingly challenging to launch original scripted half-hours . prady is repped by rothman brecher and lichter grossman ; kushell is with icm partners ; einhorn is with wme , odenkirk provissiero and bloom hergott . ©2015 the hollywood reporter . all rights reserved .
