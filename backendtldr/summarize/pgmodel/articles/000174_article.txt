( cnn ) if you 're famous and performing the american national anthem , be prepared to become a national hero or a national disgrace . facts are facts . just ask vince , whitney , roseanne , jimi and michael . mötley crüe 's vince neil reminded us again this week of the dangers of tackling `` the star-spangled banner . '' sure , he can shred it on `` girls , girls , girls '' and `` dr. feelgood , '' but this is a different story -- a completely different story . to say neil butchered the song before the las vegas outlaws arena football league game would be unkind to those in the profession . there 's less carnage when butchers are done with their work . the late whitney houston set the modern standard for the national anthem at super bowl xxv . in the early stages of the gulf war in 1991 , a patriotic america saluted her performance . just six months earlier , comedian roseanne barr may have established the low-water mark . the crowd at the san diego padres game booed her rendition and president george h. w. bush called it `` disgraceful . '' there 's nothing quite like getting the presidential thumbs down . one of the most controversial and beloved versions of `` the star-spangled banner '' comes from 1969 . guitar slinger jimi hendrix inflamed mainstream america with his psychedelic take on the national anthem to the delight of the woodstock generation . and then there 's michael bolton 's version . overly wrought songs are his specialty and he does n't disappoint in that department when he sings at the american league championship series in 2003 . bolton belts it out , but there 's one little problem -- the words . can anyone say crib notes ?
