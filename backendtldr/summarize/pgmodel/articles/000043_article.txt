( cnn ) it was right after one of the longest lockouts in nba history . jeff green , then playing for the boston celtics , was looking forward to getting back to the hardwood . that was until a routine physical stopped him in his tracks . the physical revealed he had an aortic aneurysm near the left valve of his heart . `` i was shocked , '' said the memphis grizzlies small forward . `` i had no symptoms of fatigue , shortness of breath . '' green had to have open heart surgery . `` leading up to it was nerve-racking , '' he said . `` i could n't run . i could n't touch a basketball . i could n't get stressed out , it was tough . '' as green learned how doctors would open up his chest to repair his heart , he considered the possibility he may never play basketball again . `` the first couple of weeks after i was told , i really focused in on my career and what was next , '' said the basketball player . `` i wanted to make sure if i wanted to come back , i was able to come back and play the same way i did before i left . '' if that opportunity was n't there , green wanted to have a backup plan . so , he headed back to his college roots at georgetown university , finished his degree and became the first person in his family to graduate from college . green 's nba basketball career was n't over , but it was a slow progression back to the court . he missed the entire 2011-2012 season . `` i did n't even watch any basketball , '' he said . `` six months after the surgery was the first time i set foot on a court . '' it was with the hoyas where green laid back down the foundation of his game , healing his body and regaining muscle . `` the timing was off , '' he said . `` i was n't concerned about getting hit , the biggest thing was just being in shape and being able to move and being able to function on the floor . '' green believes the surgery and hard road back to the nba have given him a new perspective and more meaning in his life . `` i will never forget those days that i could walk 15 steps for five minutes , '' he said . `` now i attack every game like this could be my last . '' `` i feel like the year i missed really added more years , '' he explained . `` it added more life into what i 'm doing because i 'm more grateful for it . '' green 's now using his story to raise awareness of hidden heart risk . he also spends time with children dealing with cardiac issues -- often telling them they are `` superheroes '' and encouraging them to `` show off your scar -- embrace it !
