( cnn ) a north pacific gray whale has earned a spot in the record books after completing the longest migration of a mammal ever recorded . the whale , named varvara , swam nearly 14,000 miles ( 22,500 kilometers ) , according to a release from oregon state university , whose scientists helped conduct the whale-tracking study . varvara , which is russian for `` barbara , '' left her primary feeding ground off russia 's sakhalin island to cross the pacific ocean and down the west coast of the united states to baja , mexico . varvara 's journey surpassed a record listed on the guinness worlds records website . it said the previous record was set by a humpback whale that swam a mere 10,190-mile round trip between the `` warm breeding waters near the equator and the colder food-rich waters of the arctic and antarctic regions . '' records are nice , but bruce mate , the lead author of the study , thinks the long trip might say more about the whale than just its ability to swim . during her 14,000-mile journey , varvara visited `` three major breeding areas for eastern gray whales , '' which was a surprise to mate , who is also the director of the marine mammal institute at oregon state university . `` for her to go to mexico , '' mate said , `` it 's pretty strong evidence that it 's where she 's from . '' varvara was thought to be an endangered western whale , but her ability to `` navigate across open water over tremendously long distances is impressive , '' he said in the release , which could mean that some western gray whales are actually eastern grays . with only 150 western gray whales believed to be in existence , that number might be even lower . `` past studies have indicated genetic differentiation between the species , but this suggests we may need to take a closer look , '' mate said . fourth baby orca born this season .
