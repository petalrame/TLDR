( cnn ) when bruce jenner told abc 's diane sawyer and the world on friday night that `` yes , for all intents and purposes , i 'm a woman , '' the declaration was n't particularly surprising . paparazzi have been stalking the former olympic champion for months , breathlessly documenting his increasingly feminine appearance down to his lip gloss , pierced ears and french manicure . the social media reaction ? a cheer , a shrug -- and not much else . except the occasional prod at jenner also being republican . of course , jenner 's family owned the moment , being the reality tv mavens they are -- the jenners and the kardashians . `` so very proud of you , my hero , '' tweeted daughter kendall jenner . his other daughter kylie jenner expressed mixed emotions . `` understandingly , this has been very hard for me . you will hear what i have to say when i 'm ready to but ... this is n't about me . i 'm so proud of you , dad . you are so brave . my beautiful hero , '' she said on twitter . ex-wife kris jenner was equally supportive . `` not only was i able to call him my husband for 25 years and father of my children , i am now able to call him my hero , '' she said . stepdaughters kim , khloé and kourtney kardashian also joined the family chorus . `` love is the courage to live the truest , best version of yourself . bruce is love . i love you bruce . # prouddaughter , '' kim tweeted . `` just finished watching the # brucejennerinterview with the family . bruzer , i 'm soooo proud of you ! dads really are heros ❤️ , '' khloé said on twitter . `` could n't be a more proud daughter . with courage and bravery , let 's change the world . i am honored to stand by bruce 's side and support him , '' kourtney said . the entertainment industry was quick to embrace the news . lady gaga has long supported lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender issues . `` we have the chance to write this moment in history together , '' she tweeted . `` let 's empower people like bruce all over the world by being loving & not mean.💗 '' transgender actress laverne cox of `` orange is the new black '' gave a shout out . `` sending lots of love and support to # brucejenner and their family tonight , '' she tweeted . `` it is always brave to stand in one 's truth . congrats darling . '' the jenner interview was a key moment for advocacy groups like glaad and the national center for transgender equality , thrusting lgbt issues into the spotlight . `` today , millions of people learned that someone they know is transgender , '' glaad tweeted . `` welcome , # brucejenner , '' trans equality tweeted . `` thank you for your courage and bravery . '' as with all things , public opinion is hardly unanimous and social media only represents the views of those who post . still , there were few detractors . one man used an old testament bible verse as the basis for his stance . `` gop logic : bruce jenner is not gay ... but transgender , '' benny said on twitter . `` still forbidden by the bible but we cherrypick . '' this woman was n't sure what to make of jenner 's announcement . `` still confused about bruce jenner becoming a woman ... , '' tweeted hughey . and what would a social media event be without a good dose of humor . many folks seemed to be more intrigued by jenner 's announcement that he 's republican than him coming out as a woman . `` i accept that bruce jenner is a republican and wish him happiness , even if i ca n't understand it , '' said johnny mcnulty . `` i 'll accept bruce jenner 's choice to live how he wants much easier than leftists will accept his politics , '' countermoonbat said on twitter . and this final nugget from bibi . `` bruce jenner : *comes out as a woman* . `` everyone : `` yas girl , slay '' . `` bruce jenner : *comes out as a republican* . everyone : `` disgusting '' .
