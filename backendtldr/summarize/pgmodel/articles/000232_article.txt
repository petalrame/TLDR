( cnn ) film critic richard corliss , whose populist passion for all genres of movies illuminated time magazine 's coverage of cinema for 35 years , died thursday night in new york city . he was 71 . corliss died a week after suffering a major stroke , according to a tribute on time 's website by colleague richard zoglin , who called him `` perhaps the magazine 's most quoted writer of all time . '' unlike some critics , corliss appreciated all kinds of movies -- from the arty drama of ingmar bergman to the epic fantasy of `` the lord of the rings . '' his all-time top 100 movies list , which he compiled with fellow time critic richard schickel , contained everything from `` pulp fiction '' to `` finding nemo '' to jackie chan 's `` drunken master ii . '' `` he savored it all : the good , the bad , the indifferent . except that he was indifferent to nothing , '' zoglin wrote . `` to any fan or friend who would ask whether a new movie was ' worth seeing , ' corliss had a stock , succinct reply : ' everything is worth seeing . ' `` but corliss was not afraid to puncture hype around big movies he found overrated , including `` titanic '' ( `` dead in the water '' ) and even -- blasphemy ! -- `` star wars , '' about which he wrote , `` the movie 's ' legs ' will prove as vulnerable as c-3po 's . '' he also did n't care much for sentimental , uplifting movies that often become mainstream hits and win oscars . `` there are movies whose feel-good sentiments and slick craft annoy me so deeply that i know they will become box-office successes or top prizewinners , '' he once wrote . `` i call this internal mechanism my built-in hit detector . '' a graceful and prolific writer , corliss reviewed more than 1,000 movies , penned many time cover stories and authored four books on film , including `` mom in the movies : the iconic screen mothers you love ( and a few you love to hate ) , '' published just last year . ( it was a partnership with turner classic movies , which , like cnn , is owned by turner broadcasting . ) some credit him with coining the phrase `` drop-dead gorgeous '' to describe actress michelle pfeiffer in a review of her 1985 film , `` into the night . '' he also cleverly , and subtly , gave away the big plot spoiler of `` the crying game '' by spelling it out with the first letters of each paragraph of his review . born in philadelphia , corliss moved to new york after college and began writing film reviews for a variety of publications before joining time in 1980 . he served as editor of film comment , the movie journal of the film society of lincoln center , for 20 years , was a frequent guest on charlie rose 's talk show and made annual pilgrimages to film festivals in cannes , toronto and venice . `` it 's painful to try to find words , since richard was such a master of them , '' time editor nancy gibbs wrote in a note friday to her staffers . `` they were his tools , his toys , to the point that it felt sometimes as though he had to write , like the rest of us breathe and eat and sleep . it 's not clear that richard ever slept , for the sheer expanse of his knowledge and writing defies the normal contours of professional life . '' he is survived by his wife , mary , a noted film critic in her own right , whom he married in 1969 . people we 've lost in 2015 .
