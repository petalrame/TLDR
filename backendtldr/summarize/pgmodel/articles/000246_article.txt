( cnn ) the quaint town of dunblane , scotland , has been set abuzz by the wedding of tennis legend andy murray to his long-term girlfriend , kim sears . saturday 's event -- dubbed `` the royal wedding of scotland '' -- took place at dunblane cathedral , with cheering crowds spilling onto the streets to support their home-grown talent . the grand slam and olympic champion donned a traditional blue and green tartan kilt , while his bride dazzled in a vintage-style gown by british designer jenny packham . the people of dunblane braved wind , rain and even snow to catch a glimpse of the happy couple , having seen murray grow from a young boy into a british sporting legend . `` absolutely fabulous to see them today , especially andy coming back to his hometown , '' said one lady in the crowd . `` he 's a hero . he 's done something that all local boys would really strive to do . he 's a superstar , '' added another . the couple met at the u.s. open in 2005 and got engaged in november last year . before the ceremony , and understandably lost for words , murray resorted to a series of emoticons to sum up his excitement for the day . fellow tennis veteran rafael nadal and first minister of scotland nicola sturgeon posted their congratulatory messages on twitter . but any plans for a honeymoon have been put on hold as the world number three returns to tournament action next week .
