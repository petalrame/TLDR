( cnn ) anyone who has given birth -- or been an observer of the event -- knows how arduous it can be . but to do it live on the internet ? with two hooves sticking out for several minutes in the midst of labor ? luckily , katie -- a giraffe at the dallas zoo -- is a champ . in an hour-long labor captured by 10 cameras and streamed live by animal planet , katie gave birth to a not-so-little baby ( about 6 feet tall ) early friday evening . there was no immediate word on the newborn 's gender or condition . but there were good signs , as seen on the live stream and dallas zoo 's twitter feed -- like its ears moving , its efforts to stand , and its nursing ( or at least trying to nurse ) from mom . `` we 're so proud , '' the zoo tweeted . the newcomer 's debut was a long time coming , especially when you count for katie 's 15-month gestation period -- average for a giraffe , according to animal planet . the baby joins a sister , 4-year-old calf jamie . it was n't immediately known how many people online saw katie go into labor and give birth . but the giraffe definitely did have watchers in the form of fellow giraffes who saw the scene unfold from an abutting barn , one of them being katie 's bff jade . the fact that the spunky katie held up so well under the spotlight is n't a total shocker . the zoo describes her as the `` diva '' among a herd of 12 giraffes at the zoo who loves to `` toss her head around '' when she does n't like something . as animal planet noted , `` she 's one of the only giraffes at the dallas zoo who can stick her long tongue out on cue .
